0,david-bowie,Heroes,"I, I will be king. And you, you will be queen. Though nothing will drive them away. We can beat them, just for one day. We can be Heroes, just for one day. And you, you can be mean. And I, I'll drink all the time. 'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact. Yes we're lovers, and that is that. Though nothing, will keep us together. We could steal time,. just for one day. We can be Heroes, for ever and ever. What d'you say?. I, I wish you could swim. Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim. Though nothing, nothing will keep us together. We can beat them, for ever and ever. Oh we can be Heroes, just for one day. I, I will be king. And you, you will be queen. Though nothing will drive us away. We can be Heroes, just for one day. We can be us, just for one day. I, I can remember (I remember). Standing, by the wall (by the wall). And the guns, shot above our heads. (over our heads). And we kissed, as though nothing could fall. (nothing could fall). And the shame, was on the other side. Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever. Then we could be Heroes, just for one day. We can be Heroes. We can be Heroes. We can be Heroes. Just for one day. We can be Heroes. We're nothing, and nothing will help us. Maybe we're lying,. then you better not stay. But we could be safer, just for one day. Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh, just for one day"
0,david-bowie,Starman,"Didn't know what time it was,. The lights were low. I leaned back on my radio. Some cat was layin' down. Some rock 'n' roll 'lotta soul, he said. Then the loud sound did seem to fade. Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase. That weren't no D.J. that was hazy cosmic jive. There's a starman waiting in the sky. He'd like to come and meet us. But he thinks he'd blow our minds. There's a starman waiting in the sky. He's told us not to blow it. Cause he knows it's all worthwhile. He told me:. Let the children lose it. Let the children use it. Let all the children boogie. I had to phone someone so I picked on you. Hey, that's far out so you heard him too!. Switch on the Tv we may pick him up on channel two. Look out your window I can see his light. If we can sparkle he may land tonight. Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up. In fright. There's a starman waiting in the sky. He'd like to come and meet us. But he thinks he'd blow our minds. There's a starman waiting in the sky. He's told us not to blow it. Cause he knows it's all worthwhile. He told me:. Let the children lose it. Let the children use it. Let all the children boogie. There's a starman waiting in the sky. He'd like to come and meet us. But he thinks he'd blow our minds. There's a starman waiting in the sky. He's told us not to blow it. Cause he knows it's all worthwhile. He told me:. Let the children lose it. Let the children use it. Let all the children boogie"
0,david-bowie,Space Oddity,"Ground control to Major Tom. Ground control to Major Tom. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on. Ground control to Major Tom. (10, 9, 8, 7). Commencing countdown, engines on. (6, 5, 4, 3). Check ignition, and may God's love be with you. (2, 1, liftoff). This is ground control to Major Tom,. You've really made the grade. And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear. Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare. This is Major Tom to ground control. I'm stepping through the door. And I'm floating in the most peculiar way. And the stars look very different today. For here am I sitting in a tin can. Far above the world. Planet Earth is blue, and there's nothing I can do. Though I'm past 100,000 miles. I'm feeling very still. And I think my spaceship knows which way to go. Tell my wife I love her very much, she knows. Ground control to Major Tom,. Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong. Can you hear me Major Tom?. Can you hear me Major Tom?. Can you hear me Major Tom?. Can you.... Here am I floating round my tin can. Far above the moon. Planet Earth is blue, and there's nothing I can do...."
0,david-bowie,Life On Mars?,"It's a god-awful small affair. To the girl with the mousy hair. But her mummy is yelling No. And her daddy has told her to go. But her friend is nowhere to be seen. Now she walks through her sunken dream. To the seat with the clearest view. And she's hooked to the silver screen. But the film is a saddening bore. For she's lived it ten times or more. She could spit in the eyes of fools. As they ask her to focus on. Sailors fighting in the dance hall. Oh man! Look at those cavemen go. It's the freakiest show. Take a look at the Lawman. Beating up the wrong guy. Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know. He's in the best selling show. Is there life on Mars?. It's on Amerika's tortured brow. That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow. Now the workers have struck for fame. 'Cause Lennon's on sale again. See the mice in their million hordes. From Ibeza to the Norfolk Broads. Rule Britannia is out of bounds. To my mother, my dog, and clowns. But the film is a saddening bore. 'Cause I wrote it ten times or more. It's about to be writ again. As I ask you to focus on. Sailors fighting in the dance hall. Oh man! Look at those cavemen go. It's the freakiest show. Take a look at the Lawman. Beating up the wrong guy. Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know. He's in the best selling show. Is there life on Mars?"
0,david-bowie,Modern Love,"I know when to go out. And when to stay in. Get things done. I catch a paper boy. But things don't really change. I'm standing in the wind. But I never wave bye-bye. But I try, I try. There's no sign of life. It's just the power to charm. I'm lying in the rain. But I never wave bye-bye. But I try, I try. Never gonna fall for. Modern love walks beside me. Modern love walks on by. Modern love gets me to the church on time. Church on time terrifies me. Church on time makes me party. Church on time puts my trust in god and man. God and man no confessions. God and man no religion. God and man don't believe in modern love. It's not really work. It's just the power to charm. I'm still standing in the wind. But I never wave bye bye. But I try, I try. Never gonna fall for. Modern love walks beside me. Modern love walks on by. Modern love gets me to the church on time. Church on time terrifies me. Church on time makes me party. Church on time puts my trust in god and man. God and man no confessions. God and man no religion. God and man don't believe in modern love. Modern love - Modern love. Modern love - Modern love, walks beside me. Modern love - Modern love, walks on by"
0,david-bowie,Changes,"I still don't know what I was waiting for. And my time was running wild. A million dead-end streets. Every time I thought I'd got it made. It seemed the taste was not so sweet. So I turned myself to face me. But I've never caught a glimpse. Of how the others must see the faker. I'm much too fast to take that test. Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes. (Turn and face the strange). Ch-ch-Changes. Don't want to be a richer man. Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes. (Turn and face the strange). Ch-ch-Changes. Just gonna have to be a different man. Time may change me. But I can't trace time. I watch the ripples change their size. But never leave the stream. Of warm impermanence and. So the days float through my eyes. But still the days seem the same. And these children that you spit on. As they try to change their worlds. Are immune to your consultations. They're quite aware of what they're going through. Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes. (Turn and face the strange). Ch-ch-Changes. Don't tell them to grow up and out of it. Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes. (Turn and face the strange). Ch-ch-Changes. Where's your shame. You've left us up to our necks in it. Time may change me. But you can't trace time. Strange fascination, fascinating me. Changes are taking the pace I'm going through. Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes. (Turn and face the strange). Ch-ch-Changes. Oh, look out you rock 'n rollers. Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes. (Turn and face the strange). Ch-ch-Changes. Pretty soon now you're gonna get older. Time may change me. But I can't trace time. I said that time may change me. But I can't trace time"
0,david-bowie,Let's Dance,"Let's dance. Put on your red shoes and dance the blues. Let's dance. To the song they're playin' on the radio. Let's sway. While colour lights up your face. Let's sway. Sway through the crowd to an empty space. Chorus:. If you say run, I'll run with you. If you say hide, we'll hide. Because my love for you. Would break my heart in two. If you should fall. Into my arms. And tremble like a flower. Let's dance. For fear your grace should fall. Let's dance. For fear tonight is all. Let's sway. You could look into my eyes. Let's sway. Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight. Chorus. Let's dance. Put on your red shoes and dance the blues. Let's dance. To the song they're playin' on the radio. Let's sway. You could look into my eyes. Let's sway. Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight"
0,david-bowie,The Man Who Sold The World,"We passed upon the stair,. we spoke of was and when. Although I wasn't there,. he said I was his friend. Which came as some a surprise. I spoke into his eyes. I thought you died alone,. a long long time ago. (refr√£o). Oh no, not me. We never lost control. You're face to face. With The Man Who Sold The World. I laughed and shook his hand,. and made my way back home. I searched for form and land,. for years and years I roamed. I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions hills. We must have died alone,. a long long time ago. Who knows? not me. I never lost control. You're face to face. With the Man who Sold the World"
0,david-bowie,As The World Falls Down,"There's such a sad love. Deep in your eyes.. A kind of pale jewel. Open and closed. Within your eyes.. I'll place the sky. Within your eyes.. There's such a fooled heart. Beatin' so fast. In search of new dreams.. A love that will last. Within your heart.. I'll place the moon. Within your heart.. As the pain sweeps through,. Makes no sense for you.. Every thrill is gone.. Wasn't too much fun at all,. But I'll be there for you-ou-ou. As the world falls down.. Falling.. As the world falls down.. Falling.. Falling in love.. I'll paint you mornings of gold.. I'll spin you Valentine evenings.. Though we're strangers 'til now,. We're choosing the path. Between the stars.. I'll leave my love. Between the stars.. As the pain sweeps through,. Makes no sense for you.. Every thrill is gone.. Wasn't too much fun at all,. But I'll be there for you-ou-ou. As the world falls down.. Falling. As the world falls down.. Falling. Falling. As the world falls down.. Falling.. Falling.. Falling. Falling in love. As the world falls down.. Falling.. Falling.. Falling.. Falling in love. As the world falls down.. Makes no sense at all.. Makes no sense to fall.. Falling. As the world falls down.. Falling.. Falling.. Falling in love. As the world falls down.. Falling.. Falling. Falling in love. Falling in love. Falling in love. Falling in love. Falling in love"
0,david-bowie,Ziggy Stardust,Ziggy played guitar. jamming good with Weird and Gilly. And the spiders from Mars. He played it left hand. But made it too far. Became the special man. then we were Ziggy's band. Ziggy really sang. screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo. Like some cat from Japan. he could lick 'em by smiling. He could leave 'em to hang. Came on so loaded man. well hung and snow white tan. So where were the spiders while. the fly tried to break our balls. Just the beer light to guide us. So we bitched about his fans and. should we crush his sweet hands?. Ziggy played for time. Jiving us that we were voodoo. The kids were just crass. he was the nazz. With God given ass. He took it all too far but. boy could he play guitar. Making love with his ego. Ziggy sucked up into his mind. Like a leper messiah. When the kids had killed the man. I had to break up the band. Ziggy played gui... tar
0,david-bowie,Moonage Daydream,"I'm an alligator, I'm a mama-papa coming for you. I'm the space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you. Keep your mouth shut, you're squawking like a big monkey bird. And I'm busting up my brains for the words. Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe. Put your ray gun to my head.

0,david-bowie,Under Pressure,"Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah. Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah. Pressure, pushing down on me. Pressing down on you, no man ask for. Under pressure, that burns a building down. Splits a family in two. Puts people on streets. Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah. Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah. That's o-kay. It's the terror of knowing. What this world is about. Watching some good friends. Screaming `Let me out'. Pray tomorrow takes me higher. Pressure on people, people on streets. Doh doh doh bah bah bah bah. O-kay. Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor. These are the days it never rains but it pours. People on streets, people on streets. It's the terror of knowing. What this world is about,. Watching some good friends. Screaming `Let me out'. Pray tomorrow takes me higher. Pressure on people, people on streets. Turned away from it all, like a blind man. Sat on a fence but it don't work. Keep coming up with love. But it's so slashed and torn. Why why why?. Love love love love. Insanity laughs, under pressure we're cracking. Can't we give ourselves one more chance. Why can't we give love one more chance. Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love, give love. Cause love's such an old fashioned word. And love dares you to care. For the people on the edge of the night. And love dares you to change our way of. Caring about ourselves. This is our last dance. This is ourselves. Under pressure. Under pressure. Pressure"

0,david-bowie,Ashes To Ashes,"Do you remember a guy that's been. In such an early song. I heard a rumour from Ground Control. Oh no, don't say it's true. They got a message from the action man. I'm happy, hope you're happy too. I've loved all I needed to love. Sordid details following. The shreiking of nothing is killing. Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I. ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair. But I'm hoping to kick.... but the planet is growing. Ashes to Ashes, funk to funky. We know Major Tom's a junkie. Strung out on heaven's high. Hitting an all-time low. Time and again I tell myself. I'll stay clean tonight. But the little green wheels are following me. Oh no, not again. I'm stuck with a valuable friend. I'm happy, hope you're happy too. One flash of light...but no smoking pistol. I've never done good things. I've never done bad things. I've never done anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh. Want an axe to break the ice. Want to come down right now. Ashes to Ashes, funk to funky. We know Major Tom's a junkie. Strung out on heaven's high. Hitting an all-time low. My mother said to get things done. You better not mess with Major Tom"

0,david-bowie,China Girl,"I could escape this feeling with my China Girl. I feel a wreck without my little China Girl. I hear her heart beating loud as thunder. Saw these stars crashing. I'm a mess without my little China Girl. Wake up in the morning, where's my little China Girl. I hear her heart's beating loud as thunder. Saw these stars crashing down. I feel a-tragic like I'm Marlon Brando. When I look at my China Girl. I could pretend that nothing really meant too much. When I look at my China Girl. I stumble into town just like a sacred cow. Visions of swastikas in my head. Plans for everyone. It's in the white of my eyes. My little China Girl. You shouldn't mess with me. I'll ruin everything you are. You know;. I'll give you television. I'll give you eyes of blue. I'll give you men who want to rule the world. And when I get excited. My little China Girl says. Oh baby just you shut your mouth. She says ... sh-sh-shhh"
0,david-bowie,Young Americans,"They pulled in just behind the bridge. He lays her down, he frowns. gee my life's a funny thing. Am I still too young? . He kissed her then and there. She took his ring, took his babies. It took him minutes, took her nowhere. Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but. All night. She wants the young american. Young american, young american. She wants the young american. All right. She wants the young american. Scanning life through the picture windows. She finds the slinky vagabond. He coughs as he passes her ford mustang, but. Heaven forbid, she'll take anything. But the freak, and his type, all for nothing. He misses a step and cuts his hand, but. Showing nothing, he swoops like a song. She cries ; where have all papa's heroes gone? . All night. She wants the young american. Young american, young american. She wants the young american. All right. She wants the young american. All the way from washington. Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor. we live for just these twenty years. Do we have to die for the fifty more? . All night. He wants the young american. Young american, young american. He wants the young american. All right. He wants the young american. Do you remember, your president nixon?. Do you remember, the bills you have to pay. Or even yesterday?. Have you been an un-american?. Just you and your idol singing falsetto 'bout. Leather, leather everywhere, and. Not a myth left from the ghetto. Well, well, well, would you carry a razor. In case, just in case of depression. Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors. Blushing at all the afro-sheeners. Ain't that close to love?. Well, ain't that poster love?. Well, it ain't that barbie doll. Her heart's been broken just like you have. And. All night. You want the young american. Young american, young american.

Throw it down by my side. And he wants so to belch. But he's too full to try. So he stands up and laughs. And he zips up his fly. In the port of Amsterdam. You can see sailors dance. Paunches bursting their pants. Grinding women to porch. They've forgotten the tune. That their whiskey voice croaked. Splitting the night. With the roar of their jokes. And they turn and they dance. And they laugh and they lust. Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts. And then out of the night. With their pride in their pants. And the sluts that they tow. Underneath the street lamps. In the port of Amsterdam. There's a sailor who drinks. And he drinks and he drinks. And he drinks once again. He'll drink to the health. Of the whores of Amsterdam. Who've given their bodies. To a thousand other men. Yeah, they've bargained their virtue. Their goodness all gone. For a few dirty coins. Well he just can't go on. Throws his nose to the sky. And he aims it up above.

0,david-bowie,Baal's Hymn,"Whilst his mother's womb contained the growing Baal. Even then the sky was waiting quiet and pale. Naked, young, immensely marvellous. Like Baal loved it, when he came to us. That same sky remained with him in joy and care. Even when Baal slept peaceful and unaware. At night a lilac sky, a drunken Baal. Turning pious as the sky grows pale. So through hospital, cathedral, whiskey bar. Baal kept moving onwards and just let things go. When Baal's tired, boys, Baal cannot fall far. He will have his sky down there below. When the sinners congregate in shame together. Baal lay naked, revelling in their distress. Only sky, a sky that will go on forever. Formed a blanket for his nakedness. And that lusty girl, the world, who'll laughing yield. To the men who'll stand the pressure of her thighs. Sometimes gave him love-bites, such as can't be healed. Baal survived it, he just used his eyes. And when Baal saw lots of corpses scattered round. He felt twice the thrill, despite the lack of room. Space enough said Baal, then I'll thicken the ground. Space enough within this woman's womb. Any vice for Baal has got its useful side. It's the man who practices it, he can't abide. Vices have their point, once you see it as such. Stick to two for one will be too much. Slackness, softness are the sort of things to shun. Nothing could be harder than the quest for fun. Lots of strength is needed and experience too. Swollen bellies can embarrass you. Under gloomy stars and this poor veil of tears. Baal will graze a pasture till it disappears. Once it's been digested to the forest's teeth. Baal trod singing for a well earned sleep. Baal can spot the vultures in the stormy sky. As they wait up there to see if Baal will die. Sometimes Baal pretends he's dead, but vultures swoop. Baal in silence dines on vulture-soup. When the dark womb drags him down to its prize. What's the world still mean to Baal, he's overfed. So much sky is lurking still behind his eyes. He'll just have enough sky when he's dead. Once the Earth's dark womb engulfed the rotting Baal. Even then the sky was up there, quiet and pale. Naked, young, immensely marvellous."

Gone the roof overhead, but the sky was always there. Oh you, who are flung out, alike from heaven and from Hades. You murderers who've been so bitterly repaid. Why did you part from the mothers who nursed you as babies. It was peaceful and you slept and there you stayed. Still he explores and rakes the absinthe green oceans. Though his mother has given him up for lost. Grinning and cursing with a few odd tears of contrition. Always in search of that land where life seems best. Loafing through hells and flocked through paradises. Calm and grinning, with a vanishing face. At times he still dreams of a small field he recognises."

He protected you and me from evil women like poor Alice D. Alice was the girl that all the hippies dread. And they called her sweet Alice the head. Alice it was plain to see, was full of pot and STD. She'd attract a great big crowd, because her inner piece was much too loud. Good Buzz did the thing that all the good Buzz must. Stuck his gun in Alice's back and said This is a Buzz. Shone the flashlight in her eyes, she began to hypnotise. Buzz said What a wild sensation, guess this must be hallucination. Love is so sensational, when you fall in love with eyes dilational. Now they're taking pills in shops, Buzz is not afraid of what. Buzz and Alice D have shown the way of where the Buzz might be some day. Buzz is still a cop of course, he's the pusher on the porch."

Visions of swastikas in my head. Plans for everyone. It's in the white of my eyes. My little China Girl. You shouldn't mess with me. I'll ruin everything you are. You know;. I'll give you television.

I can't see the bridge. for the rain in my eye. Ahhh.... And the world is full of life. Full of folk who don't know me. And they walk in twos or threes or mor. While the light that shines above the grocer's store. Investigates my face so rudely. And my essays lying scattered on the floor. Fulfill their needs just by being there. And my hands shake, my head hurts,. my voice sticks inside my throat. I'm invisible and dumb,. And no-one will recall me. And I can't see the water. through the tears in my ey-y-yes."

0,david-bowie,Cygnet Committee,"I bless you madly, sadly as I tie my shoes. I love you badly, just in time, at times, I guess. Because of you I need to rest. Because it's you that sets the test. So much has gone and little is new. And as the sparrow sings. Dawn chorus for. Someone else to hear. The Thinker sits alone growing older. And so bitter. I gave Them life. I gave Them all. They drained my very soul...dry. I crushed my heart to ease Their pains. No thought for me remains there. Nothing can They spare. What of me?. Who praised Their efforts to be free?. Words of strength and care and sympathy. I opened doors that would have blocked Their way. I braved Their cause to guide, for little pay. I ravaged at my finance just for Those. Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility. Those who said a new world, new ways ever free. Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me. I bless you madly, sadly as I tie my shoes. I love you badly, just in time, at times, I guess. Because of you I need to rest, oh yes. Because it's you that sets the test. So much has gone and little is new. And as the sunrise stream. Flickers on me,. My friends talk. Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word. We had a friend, a talking man. Who spoke of many powers he had. Not of the best of men, but Ours. We used him. We let him use his powers. We let him fill Our needs. Now We are strong. And the road is coming to its end. Now the damned have no time to make amends. No purse of token fortune stands in Our way. The silent guns of love will blast the sky. We broke the ruptured structure built of age. Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage. Where money stood. We planted seeds of rebirth. And stabbed the backs of fathers. Sons of dirt. Infiltrated business cesspools. Hating through Our sleeves. Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat. Stoned the poor on slogans such as. Wish You Could Hear. Love Is All We Need. Kick Out The Jams. Kick Out Your Mother. Cut Up Your Friend. Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End. And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above. And We Can Force You to Be Free. And We Can Force You to Believe. And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain. For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain. For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain. It said. I believe in the Power of Good. I Believe in the State of Love. I Will Fight For the Right to be Right. I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right. And I open my eyes to look around. And I see a child laid slain on the ground. As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows. Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command. But not hearing anymore. Not hearing anymore. Just the shrieks from the old rich. And I Want to Believe. In the madness that calls now. And I want to Believe. That a light's shining through. Somehow. And I Want to Believe. And You Want to Believe. And We Want to Believe. And We Want to Live. Oh, We Want to Live. We Want to Live. We Want to Live. We Want to Live. We Want to Live. We Want to Live. I Want to Live. I Want to Live. I Want to Live. I Want to Live. I Want to Live. I Want to Live. Live. Live. Liiive"

When here was love in the eyes of just one girl. That day, that precious day. When even a fool learns to love. But Oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream. Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed. With thunderous applause looked down from above. On a clown and an angel so much in love. I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream. And even a fool learns to love. That day, that hateful day. The joke turned stale, the game was over. Those spiteful words Oh, go away. Who wants to play?. It's getting late now.. My world, my funny world. Had lost its mask and shown a broken heart. A time, a sour time. When even a fool learns to love. But Oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream. Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed. With thunderous applause looked down from above.

Cried so much his face was wet. then I knew he was not lying. I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies. I saw boys, toys electric irons and T.V.'s. My brain hurt like a warehouse. it had no room to spare. I had to cram so many things. to store everything in there. And all the fat-skinny people,. and all the tall-short people. And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people. I never thought I'd need so many people. A girl my age went off her head. hit some tiny children. If the black hadn't a-pulled her off,. I think she would have killed them. A soldier with a broken arm,. fixed his stare to the wheel of a Cadillac. A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest. and a queer threw up at the sight of that. I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour. drinking milk shakes cold and long. Smiling and waving and looking so fine. don't think you knew you were in this song. And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor. And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there. Your face, your race, the way that you talk. I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk. We've got five years, stuck on my eyes. We've got five years, what a surprise. We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot.

And red mutant eyes gaze down on Hunger City. No more big wheels. Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats. And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes. Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers. Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue. Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now legwarmers. Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald. Any day now."

Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons over its web,. In weeks creating a macabre. Shrine of remains. Its web was also unique in that it had many layers,. Like floors in a buuilding. At the top of this palace-like place, assembled with almost apparent. Care, were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew-drops.. One could almost call it an altar.. When the breeze blew thru this construction,. It produced sounds of wailing, crying.. Tiny wails, tiny cries.. The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically. For their mother.. But the Glass Spider would have long gone, having known that the babies. Would survive someone on their own.. Oh-The Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like-a human's.. They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries.. Don't you hear this wasted cry, Life is over you. (Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone). But you've seen who's in heaven. Is there anyone in hell. (Mummy come back 'cause it's dark now). Take care, take care.. (Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone). Somewhere she glows divine. Somewhere she wakes alone.. But you, you've promise in your lovin' eye. God it's dark now.. Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah. Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah. Gone, Gone the water's all gone. Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone. Stay low on the ground, fire can drive you, savage and afraid. Spitting the dawn, come come come along before the animals awake. Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left..

0,david-bowie,God Knows I'm Good,"I was walking through the counters of a national concern. And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder. And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean. As the merchandise exchanged and money roared. And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak. Into the paper bag at her side. And her face was white with fear in case her actions. were observed. So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind. Crying. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good. God may look the other way today. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good. God may look the other way today. Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag. Perspiration trickled down her forehead. And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder. She was led away bewildered and amazed. Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter. As her escort asked her softly for her name. And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady. Who had fainted to the whirling wooden floor. Crying. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good. Surely God won't look the other way. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good.

I was open to pain and crossed by the rain. And I walked on a crooked crutch. I strolled all alone through a fallout zone. Came out with my soul untouched. I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd. But when they said 'Sit down' I stood up. Ooh-ohh ooh hoo growin' up. The flag of piracy flew from my mast. My sails were set wing to wing. I had a jukebox graduate for first mate. She couldn't sail but she sure could sing. I pushed the B-52 and bombed em with the blues. With my gear set stubborn on standing. I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school. Never once gave thought to landing, no. I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd. But when they said Come down I threw up. Ooh-ooh growin' up. I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere. And you know it's really hard to hold your breath. And I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared. I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress. Well my feet finally took root in the earth. But I got me a nice little place in the stars. And I swear I found the key to the universe. In the engine of an old parked car. I hid in the mother breast of the crowd. But when they said move down I moved up. Ooh ooh ooh, don't you know that I'm growin' up."

Though I eat from tins, I'm healthier. Though I live in slums, I'm purer than you, my friend. Too bad, I'm not losing sleep. [Too bad] I'm just counting sheep. [Too bad] I'm not losing sleep, my friend. Look around and see the friends. The ones you left, our friends deserted. See the guys that used to talk and drink with you. Don't look down your nose at me. 'Cause I won't ask your sympathy. I won't be your yes-sir man for anything. Too bad, I'm not losing sleep. [Too bad] I'm just counting sheep. [Too bad] I'm not losing sleep, my friend. I would walk with you. Talk with you, drink with you. If you drop that halo that you're wearing on the ground. Too bad, I'm not losing sleep. [Too bad] I'm just counting sheep. [Too bad] I'm not losing sleep, my friend. I can't get my satisfaction. Knowing you won't get reaction. What makes me the big attraction anyway. It's too bad, I'm not losing sleep. [Too bad] I'm just counting sheep. [Too bad] I'm not losing sleep, my friend. Too bad, I'm not losing sleep. [Too bad] I'm just counting sheep.

Trying to keep a straight course is not easy. Somebody special. Looking at me. Same kind of reaction. Wanted to crie with me. Lived here and there. It's too easy to say. But the service just a game a game-ame-ame-ame. I would do anything for you. I would come all day. I would swim all the oceans blue hu. I would walk a thousand miles. Reveal my secrets. More than enough for me to share. I will put roses around the door. Sit in the garden. Growing potatoes by the score. Shake your head girl, with your ponytail. Takes me right back [when you were young]. Throw your precious gifts into the air. Watch them fall down [when you were young]. Your love - feel you put them on the ground. It use to fall apart [when you were young]. Your love - feel you put them on the ground. The hills were higher [when you were young]. Your love - feel you put them on the ground. The trees were taller then [when you were young]. Your love - feel you put them on the ground. The grass was greener [when you were young]. Your love could feel you with devotion."

And meet me across the river. Just shoots and ladders and this is the kiss. American Anna, fantastic Alsatian. From nowhere to nothing. And I go way back. Children swarm like thousands of bugs. Towards the lights the beacons above the hill. The stars to the West, the South, the North and to the East. Now you could say I've got a gift of sorts. A fear of rear windows and swinging doors. A love of violence and dread of sighs. If you can see me I can see you. If you can see me I can see you. I have seen these bairns wave their fists at God. Swear to destroy the beasts, stamping the ground. In their excitement for tomorrow. I could wear your new blue shoes. I should wear your old red dress. And walk to the crossroads. So take this knife. And meet me across the river. I will take your lands and all that lays beneath. The dust of cold flowers, prison of dark of ashes. I will slaughter your kind who descend from belief. I am the spirit of greed, a lord of theft. I'll burn all your books. And the problems they make. If you can see me I can see you. If you can see me"

In the shadow I'll clip your wings. And I'll tell you I love you. In the heat of the morning. I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze. Light my candle from the sun.

0,david-bowie,It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City,"I had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a cobra. I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a super-nova. I could walk like Brando right into the sun, an' dance just like a Casanova. With my black-jack and jacket and my hair slicked sweet. Silver studs on my duds just like a Harley in heat. When I strut down the street I can hear its' heartbeat. The sisters fell back and said Don't that man look pretty. The cripple on the corner cried out Penny, nickels for your pity. Them gasoline boys down-town, they sure talk gritty. It's so hard to be a saint in the city. I was the king of the alley, mama, I could talk some trash. I was the Prince of the Paupers, crowned down-town at the Beggars' Bash. I was a pimps main prophet, I kept everything cool. Just a back-street gambler with the luck to lo..ose. And when the heat came down it was left on the ground, mama. Devil appeared to me like Jesus through the steam in the street, an'. Showed me a hand that even the cops couldn't beat. And I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat, and It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a poor bo..oy out on the street. And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead. As the tracks clack out the rhythm, the eyes fixed straight ahead. They ride the line of balancin', hold on by just a thread. Well, it's too hot in these tunnels, you can get hit up by the heat. When you get up to get out at your next stop, but they push you right down in your seat. And your heart starts beatin' faster as you struggle to your feet. Then you're out of that hole!, back on the street. And them south-side sisters, they sure look pretty. And the cripple on the corner cries out Nickels for your pity. And them down-town boys, they sure talk gritty."

She could've been a killer if she didn't walk the way she do, and she do. She opened strange doors that we'd never close again. She began to wail jealousies scream. Waiting at the light know what I mean. Chorus: (twice). Scary monsters, super creeps. Keep me running, running scared. She asked me to stay and I stole her room. She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind. Now she's stupid in the street and she can't socialise. Well I love the little girl and I'll love her till the day she dies. She wails. Jimmy's guitar sound jealousies scream. Waiting at the light know what I mean. (Chorus) (twice). (Chorus) (twice). Oh oh woh-oh. Oh, oh-oh-oh oh. Oh oh oh, oh oh. Ashes To Ashes. Do you remember a guy that's been. In such an early song. I've heard a rumour from Ground Control. Oh no, don't say it's true. They got a message from the Action Man. I'm happy, hope you're happy too. I've loved all I've needed to love. Sordid details following. The shrieking of nothing is killing. Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I. Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair. But I'm hoping to kick but the planet it's glowing. Chorus:. Ashes to ashes, funk to funky. We know Major Tom's a junkie. Strung out in heaven's high. Hitting an all-time low. Time and again I tell myself. I'll stay clean tonight. But the little green wheels are following me. Oh no, not again. I'm stuck with a valuable friend. I'm happy, hope you're happy too. One flash of light but no smoking pistol. I never done good things. I never done bad things. I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh. Want an axe to break the ice. Wanna come down right now. (Chorus). Repeat. My mother said to get things done. You'd better not mess with Major Tom. Fashion. There's a brand new dance but I don't know its name. That people from bad homes do again and again. It's big and it's bland full of tension and fear. They do it over there but we don't do it here.

Well, how come you only want tomorrow. With its promise of something hard to do. A real life adventure worth more than pieces of gold. Blue skies above and sun on your arms strength in your stride. And hope in those squeaky clean eyes. You'll get chilly receptions everywhere you go. Blinded with desire - guess the season is on. So you train by shadow boxing, search for the truth. But it's all, but it's all used up. Break open your million dollar weapon. And push your luck, still you push, still you push your luck. A broken nosed mogul are you. One of the new wave boys. Same old thing in brand new drag. Comes sweeping into view, oh-ooh. As ugly as a teenage millionaire. Pretending it's a whizz kid world. You'll take me aside, and say. Well, David, what shall I do?. They wait for me in the hallway. I'll say Don't ask me, I don't know any hallways. But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner. I feel like a group of one, no-no. They can't do this to me. I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife. Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes. The word is that the hunted one is out there on his own. You're alone for maybe the last time. And you breathe for a long time. Then you howl like a wolf in a trap. And you daren't look behind. You fall to the ground like a leaf from the tree. And look up one time at that vast blue sky. Scream out aloud as they shoot you down. No no, I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife. I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife. And no one will have seen and no one will confess. The fingerprints will prove that you coudn't pass the test. There'll be others on the line filing past, who'll whisper low. I miss you he really had to go. Well each to his own, he was. Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-ohh. Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-ohh. Another piece of teenage wild.... Wild. Wild. Wild. Scream Like A Baby. Well I wouldn't buy no merchandise. And I wouldn't go to war. And I mixed with other colours. But the nurse doesn't care. And I hide under blankets. Or did I run away. I really can't remember. Last time I saw the light of day. But I remember Sam 'cause he was like me. Chorus:. Scream like a baby. Sam was a gun. And I never knew his last name. And we never had no fun. Well they came down hard on the faggots. And they came down hard on the street. They came down harder on Sam. And they all knew he was beat. He was thrown into the wagon. Blindfolded, chains, and they stomped on us. And took away our clothes and things. And pumped us full of strange drugs. And oh I saw Sam falling. Spitting in their eyes. But now I lay me down to sleep. And now I close my eyes. Now I'm learning to be a part of soc-society. (Chorus). No athletic program, no discipline, no book. He just sat in the backseat swearing he'd seek revenge. But he jumped into the furnace. Singing old songs we loved. (Chorus) (twice). Kingdom Come. Well I walked in the pouring rain. And I heard a voice that cries It's all in vain. The voice of doom was shining in my room. I just need one day somewhere far away. Lord I just need one day. Well I'll be breaking these rocks. And cutting this hay. Yes I'll be breaking these rocks. What's my price to pay. Well the river's so muddy, but it may come clear. And I know too well what's keeping me here. I'm just the slave of a burning ray. Oh give me the night, I can't take another sight. Please, please give me the night. Chorus. Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high. Up in the tower they're watching me hoping I'm gonna die. I won't be breaking no rocks. I said I won't be breaking no rocks. (I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh. (I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh. (I won't be breaking no rocks). When the kingdom comes (repeat ad inf). Because You're Young. Psychodelicate girl - come out to play. Little metal faced-boy - don't stay away. They're so war-torn and resigned she can't talk any more. What are they trying to prove?. What would they like to find?. It's love back to front and no sides - like I say. These pieces are broken - like I say. These pieces are broken. Hope I'm wrong but I know. Chorus:. Because you're young - you'll meet a stranger some night. Because you're young - what could be nicer for you and it makes me sad. So I'll dance my life away. A million dreams, a million scars. He punishes hard - was loving her such a crime. She took back everything she said. Left him nearly out of his mind. They're people I know - people I love. They seem so unhappy - dead or alive. It's love back to front and no sides - like I say. These pieces are broken - like I say. These pieces are broken. Hope I'm wrong but I know. (Chorus). A million dreams. A million scars. A million (repeat ad inf.). It's No Game (Part 2). Silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution. No more free steps to heaven. Just walkie-talkie - heaven or hearth. Just big heads and drums - full speed and pagan. And it's no game. I am barred from the event. I really don't understand the situation. So where's the moral. People have their fingers broken. To be insulted by these fascists it's so degrading. And it's no game. Documentaries on refugees, couples 'gainst the target. Throw a rock against the road, and it breaks into pieces. Draw the blinds on yesterday, and it's all so much scarier. Put a bullet in my brain, and it makes all the papers. And it's no game. Children round the world, put camel shit on the walls.

You won't feel so good now that you've joined the gang. Molly is the model in the ads. Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip. Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong. Cause she can't switch off now that she's joined the gang. Arthur is a singer with a band. Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage. Look at Arthur rave, all the kids are paid. They want to see the croaking man who joined the gang. You won't be alone, we've all got beery grins. It's a big illusion but at least you're in. At least you're in. This club's called The Webb, it's this month's pick. Next month we shall find a place where prices aren't so stiff. 15 bob a coke, 'fraid that's past a joke. This is how to spend now that you've joined the gang. This is what to do now that you're here. Sit round doing nothing all together very fast. Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars."

Every child's mother holds an ice-cream cone, they circle round. Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in the tent where no one goes. A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor he's clogged and clothed in saffron robes. His beads are all he owns. Slow down, slow down. Someone must have said that slow him down. Slow down, slow down. It's pictured on the arms of the Karma Man. Fairy tale skin, depicting scenes from human zoos. Impermanent toys like peace and war a gentle face you've seen before. Karma Man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life. I see my times and who I've been I only live now and I don't know why. I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but. All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin. Slow down, slow down. Someone must have said that slowed him down. Slow down, slow down. It's pictured on the arms of the Karma Man.

One open wound, wasted and drawn. No sympathy. This furious reign. I lay in bed. The monster fed, the body bled. I turned and said. I get some of you all the time. All of you some other time. This rage in me. Get away from me. I'm falling, man. I'm choking, man. I'm fading, man. And a broken line. I'm falling, man. I'm choking, man. I'm fading, man. Just killing a little time.

We claimed the very source of joy ran through. It didn't, but it seemed that way. I kissed a lot of people that day. Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon. To paint that love upon a white balloon. And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops. That man has pushed beyond his brain. Satori must be something just the same. We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size. We talked with tall Venusians passing through. And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head. And away they soared. Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud. Someone passed some bliss among the crowd. And We walked back to the road, unchained.

Somewhere, someone's calling me. When the chips are down. I'm just a travelling man. Maybe it's just a trick of the mind, but. Somewhere there's a morning sky. Bluer than her eyes. Somewhere there's an ocean. Innocent and wild. Africa is sleepy people. Russia has its horsemen. Spent some nights in old Kyoto. Sleeping on the matted ground. Cyprus is my island. When the going's rough. I would love to find you. Somewhere in a place like that. Somewhere, someone's calling me. When the chips are down. I stumble like a blind man. Can't forget you. Can't forget you. Feeling like a shadow. Drifting like a leaf. I stumble like a blind man. Can't forget you. Can't forget you. Can't forget you"

I absolutely love you. But we're absolute beginners. But if my love is your love. We're certain to succeed"

Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph. He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone. Panic in Detroit (oh oh oh aahh, oh oh oh aahh). He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom. The police had warned of repercussions. They followed none too soon. A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive. Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph. He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone. Panic in Detroit (oh oh oh aahh, ah ah ah aahh). Putting on some clothes I made my way to school. (oh oh oh). And I found my teacher crouching in his overalls. I screamed and ran to smash my favourite slot machine (oh oh oh). And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights. Having scored a trillion dollars, made a run back home. Found him slumped across the table. A gun and me alone. I ran to the window. Looked for a plane or two. Panic in Detroit. He'd left me an autograph. Let me collect dust. I wish someone would phone. Panic in Detroit. Panic in Detroit. Panic in Detroit."

Till the war came along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot. And in this little yard, there's a little old man. With a little shovel in his little bitty hand. He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves. He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home. Ah-choo ! excuse me. Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed. As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed. Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care. If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair. And you put it in your pocket. God, it's pouring down. Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy. She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys. And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell. So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket. Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day , st ....ah choo !. Standing in the same spot by a certain grave. Mary-Ann was only 10, full of life and oh so gay. And I was the wicked man who took her life away. Very selfish, Oh God. No, Mr. GD, you won't tell.

In the port of Amsterdam. There's a sailor who sleeps. While the river bank weeps. To the old willow tree. In the port of Amsterdam. There's a sailor who dies. Full of beer, full of cries. In a drunken town fight. In the port of Amsterdam. There's a sailor who's born. On a hot muggy morn. By the dawn's early light. In the port of Amsterdam. Where the sailors all meet. There's a sailor who eats. Only fish heads and tails. And he'll show you his teeth. That have rotted too soon. That can haul up the sails. That can swallow the moon. And he yells to the cook. With his arms open wide. Hey, bring me more fish. Throw it down by my side. And he wants so to belch. But he's too full to try. So he stands up and laughs. And he zips up his fly. . In the port of Amsterdam. You can see sailors dance. Paunches bursting their pants. Grinding women to porch. They've forgotten the tune. That their whiskey voice croaked. Splitting the night. With the roar of their jokes. And they turn and they dance. And they laugh and they lust. Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts. And then out of the night. With their pride in their pants. And the sluts that they tow. Underneath the street lamps. In the port of Amsterdam. There's a sailor who drinks. And he drinks and he drinks. And he drinks once again. He'll drink to the health. Of the whores of Amsterdam. Who've given their bodies. To a thousand other men. Yeah, they've bargained their virtue. Their goodness all gone. For a few dirty coins. Well he just can't go on. Throws his nose to the sky. And he aims it up above. And he pisses like I cry. On the unfaithful love. In the port of Amsterdam. In the port of Amsterdam."

As if she were a dream that must not fade. Above us in the shining summer heaven. There was a cloud my eyes dwelled long upon. It was quite white and very high above us. Then I looked up. And found that it had gone. And since that day, so many moons in silence. Have swum across the sky and gone below. The plum trees surely have been chopped for firewood. And if you ask, how does that love seem now. I must admit, I really can't remember. And yet I know what you are trying to say. But what her face was like, I know no longer. I only know I kissed it on that day. As for the kiss, I long ago forgot it. But for the cloud that floated in the sky. I know that still and shall forever know it. It was quite white and moved in very high. It may be that the plum trees still are blooming. That woman's seventh child may now be there. And yet that cloud had only bloomed for minutes.

These are children riding naked on their tourist pals. While the hollows that pass for eyes swell from withdrawal. And he lies on a mattress in a rat infested room. Talking 'bout his family and the cold back home. CHORUS. Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable. Noone over here reads the papers pal. 'Tween the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable. He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls. A small black someone jumps over the crazy white guard. Cranking up the volume of a Michael Jackson song. CHORUS. Where the frangipani scents the air. She mouths a word that breaks his stare. He grunts his reply in a garrulous croak. That's a mighty big word for a nine year old. CHORUS. Shopping for girls, shopping for girls. You gaze down into her eyes for a million miles. You wanna give her a name and a clean rag doll"

New love - a boy and girl they talking. New words - that only they can share in. New words - a love so strong it tears their hearts. To sleep - through the fleeting hours of morning.

All I have is my love of love - and love is not loving. Soul love - the priest that tastes the word and. Told of love - and how my God on high is. All love - though reaching up my loneliness evolves. By the blindness that surrounds him. Love is careless in its choosing - sweeping over cross a baby. Love descends on those defenseless. Idiot love will spark the fusion.

If you want it, boys, get it here, thing. Well, on the street where you live I could not hold up my head. For I put all I have in another bed. On another floor, in the back of a car. In the cellar like a church with the door ajar. Well, I guess we've must be looking for a different kind. But we can't stop trying 'til we break up our minds. 'Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights. Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright. I guess we could cruise down one more time. With you by my side, it should be fine.

But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner. I feel like a group of one, no-no. They can't do this to me. I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife. Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes. The word is that the hunted one is out there on his own. You're alone for maybe the last time. And you breathe for a long time. Then you howl like a wolf in a trap. And you daren't look behind. You fall to the ground like a leaf from the tree. And look up one time at that vast blue sky. Scream out aloud as they shoot you down. No no, I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife. I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife. And no one will have seen and no one will confess. The fingerprints will prove that you coudn't pass the test. There'll be others on the line filing past, who'll whisper low. I miss you he really had to go. Well each to his own, he was.

As if it was acting as her body's guardian. Wreck and duck weed slowly increased her weight. By clasping her in their slimy grip. Through her limbs, the cold blooded fishes played. Creatures and plant life kept on, thus obstructing her last trip. And the sky that same evening grew dark as smoke. And its stars through the night kept the brightness still soaring. But it quickly grew clear when dawn now broke. To see that she got one further morning. Once her pallid trunk had rotted beyond repair. It happened quite slowly that she gently slipped from God's thoughts. First with her face, then her hands, right at the last with her hair."

We claimed the very source of joy ran through. It didn't, but it seemed that way. I kissed a lot of people that day. Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon. To paint that love upon a white balloon. And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops. That man has pushed beyond his brain. Satoria must be something just the same. We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size. We talked with tall Venusians passing through. And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head. And away they soared. Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud. Someone passed some bliss among the crowd. And We walked back to the road, unchained. The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party, ha ha ha. (repeat 25 times). The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party, yeah yeah.

Chase him down the steps. They haul him through the mud and they chant for his death. And drag him to the feet of the purple headed priest. First they give you everything that you want. Then they take back everything that you have. They live upon their feet and they die upon their knees. They can work with Satan. While they dress like the saints. They know God exists for the Devil told them so. They scream my name aloud down into the well below. Here I am. Not quite dying. My body left to rot in a hollow tree. Its branches throwing shadows.

And gloomy browed with superfear their tragic endless lives. Could heave nor sigh. In solemn, perverse serenity, wondrous beings chained to life. Strange games they would play then. No death for the perfect men. Life rolls into one for them. So softly a supergod cries. Where all were minds in uni-thought. Power weird by mystics taught. No pain, no joy, no power too great. Colossal strength to grasp a fate. Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers. Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold. A man would tear his brother's flesh, a chance to die. To turn to mold.. Far out in the red-sky. Far out from the sad eyes. Strange, mad celebration. So softly a supergod cries. Far out in the red-sky. Far out from the sad eyes. Strange, mad celebration. So softly a supergod dies."

And the prayers were small and yellow. And the rumour spread that I was aging fast. Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping. By a tree. And I looked and frowned and the monster was me. Well, I said hello and I said hello. And I asked Why not? and I replied I don't know. So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be. And he laughed insane and quipped KAHLIL GIBRAN. And I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through. For I realized that God's a young man too. Ho. Oh I said So long and I waved Bye-bye. And I smashed my soul and traded my mind. Got laid by a young bordello. Who was vaguely half asleep. For which my reputation swept back home in drag. And the moral of this magic spell. Negotiates my hide. When God did take my logic for a ride. (Riding along). Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oooooh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooooh. He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips. And showed me the leather belt round his hips. My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame. He said You'll never go down to the Gods again. (Turn around, go back!). He struck the ground a cavern appeared. And I smelt the burning pit of fear. We crashed a thousand yards below. I said Do it again, do it again. (Turn around, go back!). His nebulous body swayed above. His tongue swollen with devil's love. The snake and I, a venom high. I said Do it again, do it again. (Turn around, go back!). Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply. And I was seething, breathing deeply. Spitting sentry, horned and tailed.

And the last thing on his mind. Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned. Neath the covered wooden shaft. Folds the rope. Into its bag. Blows his pipe of smolders. Blankets smoke into the room. And the day will end for some. As the night begins for one. Staring through the message in his eyes. Lies a solitary son. From the mountain called Freecloud. Where the eagle dare not fly. And the patience in his sigh. Gives no indication. For the townsmen to decide. So the village Dreadful yawns. Pronouncing gross diversion. As the label for the dog. Oh It's the madness in his eyes. As he breaks the night to cry. It's really Me. Really You. And really Me. It's so hard for us to really be. Really You. And really Me. You'll lose me though I'm always really free. And the mountain moved its eyes. To the world of realize. Where the snow had saved a place. For the Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud. And the village dreadful cried. As the rope began to rise. For the smile stayed on the face. Of the wild eyed boy from freecloud. And the women once proud. Clutched the heart of the crowd. As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand. And the Magic in the stare. Of the Wild Eyed Boy, said. Stop, Freecloud. They won't think to cut me down. But the cottages fell. Like a playing card hell. And the tears on the face. Of the Wise Boy. Came trembling down. To the rumbling ground. And the missionary mystic of peace/love. Stumbled to cry among the clouds. Kicking back the pebbles."

Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street. Back to mother, it's another empty day. Uncle Arthur likes his mommy. Uncle Arthur still reads comics. Uncle Arthur follows Batman. Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum. On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum. Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed. Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion. Sally was the real thing, not just lust. Uncle Arthur vanished quickly. Uncle Arthur and his new bride. Uncle Arthur follows Sally. Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days. Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze. Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled. Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop. He gets his pocket money, he's well fed. Uncle Arthur past the gasworks. Uncle Arthur past the river. Uncle Arthur down the high street."

For you're dancing where the dogs decay, defecating ecstasy. You're just an ally of the leecher. Locator for the virgin King, but I love you in your fuck-me pumps. And your nimble dress that trails. Oh, dress yourself, my urchin one, for I hear them on the rails. Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said. We are the dead. One thing kind of touched me today. I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid. Pressing our love through the night. Knowing it's right, knowing it's right. Now I'm hoping someone will care. Living on the breath of a hope to be shared. Trusting on the sons of our love. That someone will care, someone will care. But now. We're today's scrambled creatures, locked in tomorrow's double feature. Heaven's on the pillow, its silence competes with hell. It's a twenty-four hour service, guaranteed to make you tell. And the streets are full of press men. Bent on getting hung and buried. And the legendary curtains are drawn 'round Baby Bankrupt. Who sucks you while you're sleeping. It's the theater of financiers. Count them, fifty 'round a table. White and dressed to kill. Oh caress yourself, my juicy. For my hands have all but withered. Oh dress yourself my urchin one, for I hear them on the stairs. Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said. We are the dead. We are the dead"

Wish again, and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an overture. And trees will play the rhythm of my dream. When I live my dream, please be there to meet me. Let me be the one to understand. When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave me. Then we can live in our new land. Till the day my dream cascades around me. I'm content to let you pass me by. Till that day, you'll run to many other men. But let them know it's just for now. Tell them that I've got a dream. And tell them you're the starring role. Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy.

Did you actually become. The center of my world. The seams of my life. The streams of daydream. Like the wounds of a friend. Another the kiss of a foe. The pack of a blackened eye. A life or the crown. When I met you. I could not speak. How I met you. Then I met you. My spirit grows. My kind of truth. Could not exist. When I met you. How it's all the same. It's all the same. The sun is gone. It's all the same. But when I met you. When I met you. When I met you. When I met you. When I met you. When I met you. I was the walking dead. I was kicked in the head.

'Cause I'm only four and grown-ups walk too fast. Yesterday was horrid day, 'cause Raymond kicked my shin. And mummy says if I am good, she'll let me go to school in August. Daddy shouted loud at mummy and I dropped my toast at breakfast. And I laughed when Bonzo licked my face, because it tickled. I wonder why my daddy cries and how I wish that I was nearly five. When I'm five. I will catch a butterfly and eat it and I won't be sick. When I'm five. I will jump in puddles, laugh in church and marry my mum. And I'll let my daddy do the washing-up. If I close one eye, the people on that side can't see me. I get headaches in the morning and I rode on Freddie's tricycle. And everywhere was funny, when I ran down to the sweetshop. Then I fell and bleeded-up my knee and everybody soppied me. I saw a photograph of Jesus and I asked him if he'd make me five. I saw a photograph of Jesus and I asked him if he'd make me five.

0,david-bowie,Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud,"Solemn faced, the village settles down, undetected by the stars. And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep. And the last thing on his mind. Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned neath the covered wooden shaft. Folds the rope into its bag. Blows his pipe of smolders, blankets smoke into the room. And the day will end for some as the night begins for one. Staring through the message in his eyes, lies a solitary son. From the mountain called Freecloud where the eagle dare not fly. And the patience in his sigh. gives no indication for the townsmen to decide. So the village Dreadful yawns. pronouncing gross diversion as the label for the dog. oh it's the madness in his eyes as he breaks the night to cry. It's really me. Really you and really me. It's so hard for us to really be. Really you and really me. You'll lose me though I'm always really free. And the mountain moved its eyes. To the world of realize. Where the snow had saved a place. For the Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud. And the village Dreadful cried. As the rope began to rise. For the smile stayed on the face. Of the Wild Eyed Boy from freecloud. And the women once proud clutched the heart of the crown. As the boulders smashed down from the mountains hand. And the magic in the stare of the Wild Eyed Boy said. Stop, freecloud! They won't think to cut me down. But the cottages fell like the playing card hell. The tears on the face of a Wise Boy. Came trembling down to the rumbling ground. And the missionary mystic of peace/love. Stumbled back to cry among the clouds. Kicking back the pebbles. From the Freecloud mountain track."

And I'm gonna tell the things you've done. When you're walking through the park. Some night on a thrill-less street. Will come a silent gun. You've got a dangerous part. You stole their trust, their moon, their sun. They'll come such a dart and it's needle on a crowded train. I bet you'll feel so lonely. You could die. Buildings crammed with people, landscape filled with wrath. Grey concrete city, rain has wet the street. I want to see you clearly before you close the door. A room of bloody history, you made sure of that. I can see you as a corpse hanging from a beam. I can read you like a book. I can feel you falling. I hear you moaning in your room. Oh, see if I care. Oh please, please make it soon. Walls have got you cornered. You've got the blues my friend. And people don't like you. But you will leave without a sound or a God, an end. Oh hopefully, I love you. Death along shall love you. I bet you'll feel so lonely you could die. You feel so lonely you could die. You feel so lonely you could die"

1,paul-mccartney,Eleanor Rigby,"Ah, look at all the lonely people!. Ah, look at all the lonely people!. Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church. Where a wedding has been. Lives in a dream. Waits at the window. Wearing a face that she keeps in a jar by the door. Who is it for?. All the lonely people. Where do they all come from?. All the lonely people. Where do they all belong?. Father Mckenzie, writing the words of a sermon. That no one will hear. No one comes near. Look at him working, darning his socks in the night. When there's nobody there. What does he care?. All the lonely people. Where do they all come from?. All the lonely people. Where do they all belong?. Ah, look at all the lonely people!. Ah, look at all the lonely people!. Eleanor Rigby died in the church. And was buried along with her name. Nobody came. Father Mckenzie wiping the dirt from his hands. As he walks from the grave. No one was saved. All the lonely people. Where do they all come from?. All the lonely people. (Ah, look at all the lonely people!). Where do they all belong?"

1,paul-mccartney,Back in Brazil,"Back in Brazil, there lives a girl. Dreams of the future, and a far, far better world. Back in Brazil, she meets a man. He's tall and handsome, and he fits in with her plan. Bright lights ahead, music and fun. Nights are for dancing, and the days are for the sun. All kinds of weather will surely come and go. But they're together. And together they will steal the show. Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!. Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!. Ichiba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ban!. Back in Brazil, she makes a date. He has to cancel, 'cause they got him working late. Back in Brazil, she feels afraid. Hope starts to crumble. And her dreams begin to fade. Her lights are out, she's gone to bed. Nights are for sleeping if a girl's to get ahead. Even the weather has started changing too. But they'll be together. And together they will make it through. Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!. Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!. Ichiban!. So we raise a family as the clouds roll by. Making pictures of us in the sky. The kids are happy and they don't ask why. Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa, you and I"

Dark distant mountains with valleys of green.. Past painted deserts. The sunset's on fire. As he carries me home to the mull of kintyre.. Mull of Kintyre. Oh mist rolling in from the sea,. My desire is always to be here. Oh mull of kintyre. Sweep through the heather like deer in the glen. Carry me back to the days I knew then.. Nights when we sang like a heavenly choir. Of the life and the time of the mull of kintyre.. Mull of Kintyre. Oh mist rolling in from the sea,. My desire is always to be here. Oh mull of kintyre. Smiles in the sunshine. And tears in the rain. Still take me back to where my memories remain. Flickering embers growing higher and higher. As they carry me back to the mull of kintyre. Mull of Kintyre. Oh mist rolling in from the sea,. My desire is always to be here. Oh mull of kintyre. Mull of Kintyre. Oh mist rolling in from the sea,. My desire is always to be here"

Shouting at the world. I don't need love. though temptation is sweet. Give me your hand. 'Til I'm back on me feet. You're always telling me about my misery. I've seen things you will never see. Don't pity me. I'll stand up again. Kick up a fuss again too. I'll be right again. Be upright without you. We see a life through the eyes of a man. As he live and he dies. By a simple tattoo. I'll be back again. When I land on my feet. I'll stand up again. Kick up a fuss again, wouldn't you. Well there you go, though we tried hard to know him. It's there on his face. He's a case where there's clearly no hope. Give me your hand again. 'Til I land again. His face starts to fade. As we pull down the shade. And the picture we made. Is in glorious cinemascope."

And weary eyes will search the sky. For any sign of sunlight.. For any sign of sunlight.. CHORUS. Mother and father holding their child,. Not knowing what future magic lies inside..

1,paul-mccartney,On My Way To Work,On my way to work. I rode a big green bus. I could see everything. From the upper deck. People came and went. Smoking cigarettes. I picked the packets up. When the people left. But all the time I thought of you. How far away the future seemed. How could I so many dreams?. And one of them not come true. On my way to work. I bought a magasine. Inside a pretty girl. Who liked to water-ski. She came from Chichester. To study history. She had removed her clothes. For the likes of me. But all the time I thought of you. How would you know that I was there. How could I soul-search everywhere. Without knowing what to do. On my way to work. As I was clocking in. I could see everything. How it came to be. People come and go. Smoking cigarettes. I pick the packets up. When the people leave. But all the time i think of you. How far away the future seems. How could I have so many dreams. And one of them not come true. On my way to work. But all the time I thought of you. How would you know that I was there. How could I soul search everywhere. Without knowing what to do. On my way to work (x2)
1,paul-mccartney,On The Way,Well you know I'll always love you. But it would have been a lie. If I said that I could please you. Every moment that I try. Wouldn't want to see you crying. So l hope you don't mind. The things I say. On the way. Well we've been traveling for a long time. And we finally finished here. Though I said some things to hurt you. Well it was only out of fear. Wouldn't want to see you crying. So l hope you don't mind. The things I say. On the way. Well you know I'll always love you. Everything will be alright. If I know you don't mind. The things I say. On the way. Well you know I'll always love you. Everything will be ok. If I know you don't mind. The things I say. On the way
1,paul-mccartney,Once Upon A Long Ago,Picking up scales and broken chords. Puppy dog tails in the House of Lords. Tell me darling. What can it mean?. Making up moons in a minor key. What have those tunes got to do with me?. Tell me darling. Where have you been?. Once upon a long ago. Children searched for treasure. Nature's plan went hand in hand. With pleasure. Such pleasure.. Blowing balloons on a windy day. Desolate dunes with a lot to say. Tell me darling. What have you seen?. Once upon a long ago. Children searched for treasure. Nature's plan went hand in hand. With pleasure. My pleasure.. Playing guitars on an empty stage. Counting the bars of an iron cage. Tell me darling. What can it mean?. Picking up scales and broken chords. Puppy dog tails in the House of Lords. Help me darling. What does it mean?. Once upon a long ago....

Around my hand was a plastic band. With a picture of my face. I was crying, left to die. In this godforsaken place. This godforsaken place. [Chorus:]. Only Mama knows. What she laid me down. In this godforsaken town. She was running too. What she was running from. I always wondered. I never knew. Only Mama knows. Only Mama knows. I'm passing through. I'm on my way. On the road, no ETA. I'm passing through. No fixed abode. And that is why..... I need to try. To hold on. I've got to hold on [3x]. Was it planned as a one night stand. Or did she live in disgrace. Well, I never. Will I ever. See my father's face. See my father's face. [Chorus 2x ]. Gotta hold on... [4x]"

1,paul-mccartney,Peace In The Neighborhood,"Best thing I ever saw. Was a man who loved his wife. In a place where things were good. I felt peace in the neighbourhood. That feeling in the air. Something was definitely there. It was a time when things were good. I felt peace in the neighbourhood. I was there, I really was.. At the centre of a love vibration.. People sharing with their friend.. Helping each other out. Peace in the neighbourhood. Helping each other out. Then I woke up from my dream. To see things as they really are. People struggling to survive. How can peace hope to stay alive?. Well I was there...I felt so good. At the centre of a love vibration.. People caring for their world. Helping each other out.. Peace in the neighbourhood. Helping each other out.. Peace in the neighbourhood. Helping each other out.. Best thing I ever saw. I saw a man who loved his wife.. Peace in the neighbour hood.

1,paul-mccartney,Penny Lane,"Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs. Of every head he's had the pleasure to have known. And all the people that come and go. Stop and say hello. On the corner is a banker with a motorcar. The little children laugh at him behind his back. And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain.... Very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies. I sit, and meanwhile back. In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass. And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.. He likes to keep his fire engine clean. It's a clean machine. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. Four of fish and finger pies. In summer, meanwhile back. Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout. A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray. And though she feels as if she's in a play. She is anyway. Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer. We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim. Then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain.... Very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies. I sit, and meanwhile back. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies.... Penny Lane."
1,paul-mccartney,People Want Peace,"Ladies and gentlemen. I'm standing before you. With something important to say. With some trepidation I crave your attention. But I'm not going to let anything. Get in my way. The message is simple, it's straight from my heart. And I know that you've heard before. But what does it matter. We're in it together. And I'm not quitting. while people are crying for more. People want peace. People want peace. A simple release from their suffering. People want peace. People want peace. Nothing in life is as sad. As a lonely soul searching for peace. Only to find disappointment is waiting. Behind every door that we open. Every catch we release. Brothers and sisters. I beg you to listen. I know that it isn't too late. For we are the people. The voices of freedom. And we're all perfectly clear that we. Don't want to wait. People want peace. People want peace. A simple release from their suffering. People want peace. People want peace. People want peace. People want peace. People want peace. People want peace"

But I can laugh it off. And act like nothing's wrong. But why pretend. I think I've heard enough. Of your familiar song. I tell you what I'm going to do. I'll try to take my mind off you. And now that you don't need my help. I'll use the time to think about myself. You're not aware. Of what you put me through. But now the feeling's gone. But I don't mind. Do what you have to do. You don't fool anyone. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'll take a different point of view. And now that you don't need my help. I'll use the time to think about myself. The definition of friendship. Apparently ought to be. Showing support for the one that you love. And I was open to friendship. But you didn't seem to have any to spare. While you were riding to Vanity Fair. There was a time. When every day was young. The sun would always shine. We sang along. When all the songs were sung. Believing every line. That's the trouble with friendship. For someone to feel it. It has to be real or it wouldn't be right. And I keep hoping for friendship. But I wouldn't dare to presume it was there.

1,paul-mccartney,Road,"We came from nowhere. Hiding from a storm. We cling together. To keep each other warm. The road to somewhere. Stretches through the night. We follow blindly. Heading for the light. I can't see anymore. The blinding light. It's just a metaphor. I use when things aren't going right. We held each other. Praying for a spark. Two crazy partners. Scrambling in the dark. Now where are we going. Searching in the night. We had a feeling. It's going to be alright. I can't see anymore. The blinding light. It's just a metaphor. I use when things aren't going right. Two crazy partners. Searching in the night. We've got a feeling. It's going to be alright. We follow blindly. Heading for the light. We've got a feeling. It's gonna be, it's gonna be alright. We came from nowhere. Hiding from a storm. We cling together. To keep each other warm. The road to somewhere. Stretches through the night. We follow blindly. Heading for the light"

1,paul-mccartney,Run Devil Run,Run devil run. The angel's having fun. Making winners out of sinners. Better leave before he's done. When he gets throught he'll be coming after you. Listen what I'm saying to you run. Run devil run. By a swamp in Alabama in the cold and the damp. Sitting reading by the light of a kerosene lamp. Lives a holy roller with a mission on her mind. Got to spread the word to anybody she can find. You can hear her screaming any time of night or day. This is what she says to keep her demons away. Run devil run. The angel's having fun. Making winners out of sinners. Better leave before he's done. When he gets throught he'll be coming after you. Listen what I'm saying to you run. Run devil run. Her brother and her sister said that she brought them down. Stepping on a bus that was heading for town. There they started drinking they got into a fight. The sheriff introduced them to the jailhouse for a night. When the holy roller came to town to pay the bail. This is what she sang as she was leaving the jail. Run devil run. The angel's having fun. Making winners out of sinners. Better leave before he's done. When he gets throught he'll be coming after you. Listen what I'm saying to you run. Run devil run. Well by the middle of the summer they were back at the shack. Picking cotton for a living keeping on the right track. Visiting the neighbours trying to spread the good news. Singing gospel music with a hint of the blues. All of them determined to deliver the goods. Man you hear the music coming out of the woods. Run devil run. The angel's having fun. Making winners out of sinners. Better leave before he's done. When he gets throught he'll be coming after you. Listen what I'm saying to you run. Run devil run. By a swamp in Alabama in the cold and the damp. Sitting reading by the light of a kerosene lamp. Lives a holy roller with a mission on her mind. Got to spread the word to anybody she can find. You can hear her screaming any time of night or day. This is what she says to keep her demons away. Run devil run. The angel's having fun. Making winners out of sinners.

And a broker awoke her from a fitful slumber. Then consulted his shares and his stocks. Down down down they go. Down down how he'll never know. Tommy's coming home again. And it's almost April Fools' Day. As he glanced on his paper looking through the veil. He could see she was really upset. As she tucked back the ribbon in a velvet box. As he offered her a cigarette. Down down down she took a drag. Now he's covered in a flag. Tommy's coming home again. And it's almost April Fools' Day. Almost April Fools' Day. And the joke's on everyone. He had that premonition. Only dead men dwell upon. But how could he know that only twelve months later. She would wear her skirt up over her knee. And in the very same carriage she'd be flattened with roses. And forget the tears of bigotry. Down down down they flow. Now now now it just don't matter anymore. Tommy made it home again. When it was almost April Fools' Day. Almost April Fools' Day. And the joke's on everyone. He had that premonition. Only dead men dwell upon. Tommy's coming home again. Tommy's coming home again. Tommy's coming home

Till quarter to three,. Would you lock the door?. Will you still need me,. Will you still feed me,. When I'm sixty-four?. You'll be older too. And if you say the word. I could stay with you. I could be handy. Mending a fuse,. When your lights have gone.. You can knit a sweater by the fireside.. Sunday mornings go for a ride.. Doing the garden,. Digging the weeds,. Who could ask for more?. Will you still need me,. Will you still feed me,. When I'm sixty-four?. Every summer we can rent a cottage in the isle of Wight. If it's not too dear.. We shall scrimp and save. Grandchildren on your knee. Vera, Chuck and Dave.. Send me a postcard,. Drop me a line,. Stating point of view.. Indicate precisely what you mean to say.. Yours sincerely wasting away.. Give me your answer,. Fill in a form, -. Mine for ever more.. Will you still need me,. Will you still feed me. When I'm sixty-four."

Who cares about you?. I do. 'Cause you're worth much more. A fact you can be sure. No need to hide. The love you've got inside. Did you ever get lost in the heart of a crowd. And the people around. keep on pushing you down?. Is it driving you mad. and you're screaming out loud. And you're wondering. who's going to recognize you. You're a ghost in the dark. Who cares what the idiots say?. Who cares what the idiots do?. Who cares about the pain in your heart?. Who cares about you?. Who cares what the idiots say?. Who cares what the idiots do?. Who cares about the pain in your heart?. Who cares about you?. I do. You've been left in the rain"

From the pages of a paper candles shine. On a perfect table laid for two who love to dine. They suggest a highly recommended wine. Once again the same old line. Why so sad. My fine young friend. Why so blue. Weary carriage horses stand in single file. Someone at a crowded bus stop wears a friendly smile. Touching nerves that no one's heard from in a while. Papers from the same old file. Why so sad. My fine young friend. Why so blue. Sometimes when eyes meet. You know. They have to meet again. Sometimes birds of a feather. Got to fly. Together oh. From a dingy attic window candles shine. On a perfect table laid for two who love to dine. Now they drink the highly recommended wine. Free at last and feeling fine. I'm so glad (I am so glad). My (It's not so bad). fine (It's not the end). young (I am the friend). friend (I am the friend). Glad for you. Well I'm so glad (I'd be so sad).

2,laura-pausini,La Solitudine,"Marco se n'√® andato e non ritorna pi√π. E il treno delle 7:30 senza lui. √® un cuore di metallo senza l'anima. Nel freddo del mattino grigio di citt√†. A scuola il banco √® vuoto, marco √® dentro me. √® dolce il suo respiro fra i pensiere miei. Distanze enormi sembrano dividerci. Ma il cuore batte forte dentro me. Chiss√† se tu mi penserai. Se con i tuoi non parli mai. Se ti nascondi come me. Sfuggi gli sguardi e te ne stai. Rinchiuso in camera e non vuoi mangiare. Stringi forte a te il cuscino. Piangi e non lo sai quanto altro male ti far√† la solitudine. Marco nel mio diario ho una fotografia. Hai gli occhi di bambino un poco timido. La stringo forte al cuore e sento che ci sei. Fra i compiti d'inglese e matematica. Tuo padre e i suoi consigli che monotonia. Lui con il suo lavoro ti ha portato via. Di certo il tuo parere non l'ha chiesto mai. Ha detto un giorno tu mi capirai. Chiss√† se tu mi penserai. Se con gli amici parlerai. Per non soffrire pi√π per me. Ma non √® facile lo sai. A scuola non ne posso pi√π. E i pomeriggi senza te. Studiare √® inutile tutte le idee si affollano su te. Non √® possibile dividere la vita di noi due. Ti prego aspettami amore mio.... Ma illuderti non so!. La solitudine fra noi. Questo silenzio dentro me. e l'inquietudine di vivere la vita senza te. Ti prego aspettami perch√©. Non posso stare senza te. Non √® possibile dividere la storia di noi due. La solitudine fra noi. Questo silenzio dentro me. e l'inquietudine di vivere la vita senza te. Ti prego aspettami perch√©. Non posso stare senza te. Non √® possibile dividere la storia di noi due. La solitudine"
2,laura-pausini,Strani Amori,"Mi dispiace devo andare via. Ma sapevo che era una bugia. Quanto tempo perso dietro a lui. Che promette e poi non cambia mai. Strani amori mettono nei guai. Ma, in realt√†, siamo noi. E lo aspetti ad un telefono. Litigando che sai libero. con il cuore nel lo stomaco. Un gomitolo nell'angolo. L√¨ da sola, dentro un brivido. Ma perch√© lui non c'√®. E sono strani amori che. Fanno crescere e sorridere. Fra le lacrime. Quante pagine l√¨ da scrivere. Sogni e lividi da dividere. Sono amori che spesso a questa et√†. Si confondono dentro a quest'anima. Che si interroga senza decidere. Se √® un amore che va per noi. E quante notte perse a piangere. Rileggendo quelle lettere. Che non riesci pi√π a buttare via. Dal labirinto della nostalgia. Grandi amori che finiscono. Ma perch√© restano nel cuore. Strani amori che vanno e vengono. Nei pensieri che l√¨ nascondono. Storie vere che ci appartengono. Ma si lasciano come noi. Strani amori fragili. Prigionieri, liberi. Strani amori mettono nei guai. Ma, in realt√†, siamo noi. Strani amori fragili. Prigionieri, liberi. Strani amori che non sanno vivere. E si perdono dentro noi. Mi dispiace devo andare via. Questa volta l'ho promesso a me. Perch√© ho voglia ad un amore vero. Senza te"

Perch√© oramai sarai. Incancellabile. Con la tua voce l'allegria. Che dentro me non va pi√π via. Come un tatuaggio sulla pelle. Ti vedo dentro gli occhi suoi. Ti cerco quando non ci sei. Sulle mie labbra sento la voglia che ho di te. Cos√¨ profondamente mio. Non ho mai avuto niente io. Tu non lasciarmi mai. Tu non lasciarmi.... E pi√π ti guardo e pi√π lo sai. Di te io m'innamorerei. Tu non lasciarmi mai. Tu non lasciarmi. Non farlo mai perch√©. Se guardo il cielo. Io sento che sarai. Incancellabile oramai. Tu non lasciarmi mai. Tu non lasciarmi.... Incancellabile tu sei. I miei respiri e I giorni miei. Tu non lasciarmi.... E si fa grande. Dentro me. Questo bisogno. Che ho di te. Tu non lasciarmi mai. Tu non lasciarmi.... E pi√π mi manchi e pi√π tu sei. Al centro dei pensieri miei. Tu non lasciarmi mai. Da sola senza te. Ora e per sempre resterai. Dentro I miei occhi.... Incancellabile!
2,laura-pausini,La Soledad,"Marco se ha marchado para no volver. El tren de la ma√±ana llega ya sin √©l. Es s√≥lo un coraz√≥n con alma de metal. En esta niebla gris que envuelve la ciudad. Su banco est√° vacio, Marco sigue en m√≠. Le siento respirar pienso que sigue aqu√≠. Ni la distancia enorme puede dividir. Dos corazones y un solo latir. Quizas si t√∫ piensas en m√≠. Si a nadie t√∫ quieres hablar. Si t√∫ te escondes como yo. Si huyes de todo y si te vas. Pronto a la cama sin cenar. Si aprietas fuerte contra ti. La almohada y te echas a llorar. Si t√∫ no sabes cuanto mal. Te har√° la soledad.... Miro en mi diario tu fotograf√≠a. Con ojos de un muchacho un poco t√≠mido. La aprieto contra el pecho y me parece que. Est√°s aqu√≠ entre ingl√©s y matem√°ticas. Tu padre y sus consejos, que monoton√≠a. Por causa del trabajo y otras tonter√≠as. Te ha llevado lejos sin contar contigo. Y ha dicho un d√≠a lo comprender√°s. Quizas si t√∫ piensas en m√≠. Con los amigos dever√°s. Tratando s√≥lo de olvidar. No es nada facil la verdad. En clases ya no puedo m√°s. Y por las tardes es peor. No tengo ganas de estudiar. Por ti mi pensamiento va. Es imposible dividir as√≠. La vida de los dos. Por eso esp√©rame, cari√±o m√≠o. Conserva la ilusi√≥n. La soledad entre los dos. Este silencio en mi interior. Esta inquietud a ver pasar as√≠. La vida sin tu amor. Por eso esp√©rame porque. Esto no puede suceder. Es imposible separar as√≠. La historia de los dos. La soledad entre los dos. Este silencio en mi interior. Esa inquietud a ver pasar as√≠. La vida sin tu amor. Por eso esp√©rame porque. Esto no puede suceder. Es imposible separar as√≠. La historia de los dos. La soledad..."

Porque mi vida se qued√≥ vac√≠a. Nadie contesta mis preguntas, porque. Nada me queda, sin √©l. Se fue. Se fue, el perfume de sus cabellos. Se fue, el murmullo de su silencio. Se fue, su sonrisa de f√°bula. Se fue, la dulce miel que prob√© en sus labios. Se fue, me qued√≥ solo su veneno. Se fue, y mi amor se cubri√≥ de hielo. Se fue, y la vida con √©l se me fue. se fue, y desde entonces ya solo tengo l√°grimas. Encadenada a noches de locura. Hasta a la c√°rcel yo ir√≠a con √©l. Toda una vida no basta, sin √©l. En mi verano ya no sale el sol. Con su tormenta, todo destruy√≥. Rompiendo en mil pedazos. esos sue√±os que construimos, ayer!. Se fue. Se fue, me qued√≥ solo su veneno. Se fue, y mi amor se cubri√≥ de hielo. Se fue, y la vida con √©l se me fue. Se fue, y la raz√≥n no la s√©. Si existe Dios, debe acordarse de m√≠. Aunque se, que entre √©l y yo. El cielo tiene solo nubes negras. Le rogar√©, le buscar√©, lo juro, le encontrar√©. Aunque tuviera que buscar en un mill√≥n de estrellas. En esta vida obscura, absurda sin √©l. Siento que. Se ha convertido en centro y fin de todo mi universo. Si tiene l√≠mite, el amor, lo pasar√≠a por √©l. Y en el vac√≠o inmenso de mis noches, yo le siento. le amar√©. como le pude amar la vez primera. que un beso suyo era una vida entera. sintiendo como me pierdo. por √©l. Se fue. Se fue, el perfume de sus cabellos. Se fue, el murmullo de su silencio. Se fue, su sonrisa de f√°bula. Se fue, la dulce miel que prob√© en sus labios. Se fue, me qued√≥ solo su veneno. Se fue, y mi amor se cubri√≥ de hielo. Se fue, se fue, y la vida con √©l se me fue. se fue, y la raz√≥n no la s√©"

Di una generazione fatta come me. La stessa pioggia, lo stesso sole. Tu sai che un'altra come questa no, non c'√®. √à un'onda di marea, che spezza gli argini. E cerca una risposta dentro se. E basta quest'idea per riconoscersi. Da un gesto e da uno sguardo che. Da solo parla gi√† di noi. La stessa rabbia. Lo stesso amore. Di una generazione. Fatta come me. Gli stessi sogni. Stesso dolore. Perch√© sai un'altra. Come questa no. Non c'√®. Gli stessi occhi. Lo stesso cuore. Di una generazione. Fatta come me. La stessa pioggia. Lo stesso sole. Tu sai un' altra. Come questa. No, non c'√®. Cr√©dito: Jack Mcphee"

E allora scoprirai. Che la storia di ogni nostro minuto. Appartiene soltanto a noi.. Ma se ancora resterai,. Persa senza una ragione. In un mare di perch√©. Dentro te ascolta il tuo cuore. E nel silenzio troverai le parole.. Chiudi gli occhi e poi tu lasciati andare,. Prova a arrivare dentro il pianeta del cuore. √à difficile capire. Qual √® la cosa giusta da fare. Se ti batte nella testa un'emozione.. L'orgoglio che ti piglia,. Le notti in cui il rimorso ti sveglia. Per la paura di sbagliare,. Ma se ti ritroverai. Senza stelle da seguire. Tu non rinunciare mai. Credi in te! Ascolta il tuo cuore!. Fai quel che dice anche se fa soffrire.. Chiudi gli occhi e poi tu lasciati andare,. Prova a volare oltre questo dolore.. Non ti ingannerai. Se ascolti il tuo cuore,. Apri le braccia quasi fino a toccare. Ogni mano, ogni speranza,. Ogni sogno che vuoi. Perch√© poi ti porter√† fino al cuore. di ognuno di noi.. Ogni volta, che non sai cosa fare,. Prova a volare, dentro il pianeta del cuore.. Tu tu prova a volare. Do do do dov'√® il pianeta del cuore.. Tu tu tu dentro il pianeta del cuore."

Il sole con gli occhiali scuri se ne andr√†. √à il gioco antico degli sguardi inizier√†. Le compagnie che fanno tardi. La mattina in spiaggia siamo zombi. Quanti tramonti che non scorderemo mai. Quanti maglioni messi sulle spalle e poi. Quelle carezze sulla sabbia. Sono un faro accesso nella nebbia. Baci che si rubano. E la pioggia su di noi. In questo mare amaro. Amore di un addio. Che fugge via per sempre. Voci che si giurano. Di non lasciarsi mai. Ma gi√† le spiagge sono vuote. E questa estate se ne va. Ora che la vita √® stretta. Da questa realt√†. Per tutto un anno il cuore aspetta solo. Quella libert√†. Baci che si rubano. E la pioggia su di noi. In questo mare dire. Amore √® una bugia. Che vola via innocente. Voci che si giurano. Di non lasciarsi mai. Ma gi√† le spiagge sono vuote. E questa estate se ne va. Baci che si rubano. E la pioggia su di noi. In questo mare amaro. Amore di un addio. Che fugge via per sempre.

Quiz√°. Stop. Bienvenido el llanto y su consuelo. Y el presagio de nieve en el cielo. Bienvenido quien sonr√≠e, quien se asusta y cae. Pero sin desesperar. Bienvenido a un tren que surca mares. El que nos une a tiempo en navidades. Bienvenidos los artistas con sus intuiciones. Bienvenido aquello que somos hoy. Lo que somos hoy. De aqu√≠ no me voy. Porque somos hoy. Lo que somos hoy"

Dimmi perch√© siamo qui a lottare. Io contro te fino a stare male. Fino a quando non sar√† finita. E non c'√® mai un attimo di pace. Nessuno che parli sottovoce. Abbiamo perso il senso della vita. Certo che se ti guardi intorno. Tu lo vedi da te. Quanta rabbia c'√® che poi entra in noi. E ci mette contro non importa mai il perch√©. Quante volte ho detto vado via. Da una vita che non sento mia. Dimmi perch√© siamo tutti matti. Anche io e te come cani e gatti. E ci lasciamo sempre una ferita. La gente √® sempre pi√π cattiva. Un mare che sbatte sulla riva. Abbiamo perso il gusto della vita. Ma stasera vengo in pace e io spero che ci sia. Un minuto per parlare fuori dalla follia. Siamo cos√¨, siamo tutti matti. Anche io e te come cani e gatti. Ma se c'√® un amore non √® mai finita. E ci sar√† sempre ancora un modo. Anche per noi per slacciare il nodo. E ritrovare il gusto della vita"

2,laura-pausini,Cos√¨ Importante,Giorno dopo giorno. Sento il tempo che mi sfugge fra le mani ed io. L√¨ a rincorrere. I miei pensieri i desideri. Di questi anni a volte amari e senza regole. Li ricorderai. Come se fosse stato solo un sogno. Vivere soltanto di quegli attimi. E non cercarti piu¬¥. Ma non √® cos√¨ importante. Solo un attimo di forte nostalgia. Scivolando negli sguardi fra la gente. Io cammino indifferente per la via. Colpa di un¬¥estate. Dei profumi di una notte di un momento che. Non dimentico. Guidati dalla voglia di sentirsi. All¬¥improvviso sempre piu¬¥ vicini. Cos√¨ vicini che. Adesso √® troppo tardi per pensare. Di dimenticarti e poi rinascere. E non cercarti pi√π. Ma non so cos¬¥√® importante. Se fidarmi o non fidarmi di te. Di quel viso cos√¨ impresso nella mente. Non saprei ma ci penso sempre sai. E non c¬¥√® niente. Che cancelli il ricordo di te. Di uno sguardo malinconico e sognante. Dove sei dimmi adesso dove sei. In un attimo ritorno al mio presente. E vorrei che tu fossi ancora qui. Tu che sei cos√¨ importante. Puoi sentire il mio bisogno di te. Nei tuoi occhi vedo acqua trasparente. Come un fiume travolgente dentro me

2,laura-pausini,Dare To Live (vivere) (Part. Andrea Bocelli),"Try looking at tomorrow not yesterday. And all the things you left behind. All those tender words you did not say. The gentle touch you couldn't find. In these days of nameless faces. There is no one truth but only pieces. My life is all i have to give. Dare to live until the very last. Dare to live forget about the past. Dare to live giving something of yourself to others. Even when it seems there's nothing more left to give. Ma se tu vedessi l'uomo. Davanti al tuo portone. Che dorme avvolto in un cartone. Se tu ascoltassi il mondo una mattina. Senza il rumore della pioggia. Tu che puoi creare con la tua voce. Tu, pensi i pensieri della gente. Poi, di Dio c'e solo Dio. Vivere, nessuno mai ce l'ha insegnato. Vivere, non si pu√≤ vivere senza passato. Vivere √® bello anche se non l'hai chiesto mai. Una canzone ci sar√†, qualcuno che la canter√†. Dare to live searching for the ones you love. (Perch√©, perch√©, perch√©, perch√© non vivi questa sera?). Dare to live no one but we all. (Perch√©, perch√©, perch√©, perch√© non vivi ora?). Dare to live until the very last. (Perch√©, perch√©, perch√© la vita non √® vita). Your life is all you have to give (Perch√©). non l'hai vissuta. Vivere!. Dare to live until the very last. (Perch√©, perch√©, perch√© Ia vita non √® vita). Your life is all you have to give (Perch√©). non l'hai vissuta mai. I will say no (I will say yes). Say dare to live. Dare to live"

2,laura-pausini,El Valor Que No Se Ve,"Hay d√≠as en los que la vida se llena de porqu√©s,. La esperanza se preocupa por quererlos resolver,. Desconf√≠as de la gente, del amor y piensas que. No es posible que se sufra m√°s que t√∫.. Y esos d√≠as t√∫ te rindes al mundo en torno a t√≠. Para no sentir el miedo del valor que no se ve. Y te sientes tan perdida que ya no puedes m√°s. Sin la fu√©rza que te da la vida. Busca una salida, un ma√±ana que. Cure las heridas que hay dentro de t√≠,. Lucha por vivir, con ese valor que no se ve. Equivocarse nunca importa, vu√©lvelo a intentar. Si una puerta se te cierra, otra puerta se abrir√°. Lo que en realidad importa es no renunciar jam√°s,. Pues tal vez est√©s a un solo paso.... Busca una salida, un ma√±ana que. D√© una nueva vida a todo el mundo que. Luchar√° con fe, con ese valor que no se ve. Por todos ellos, √©chale valor,. Por quien lo pierde y lo va buscando,. Por los que se sienten tan mal como t√∫,. Por esos que esperan sin desesperar, como t√∫. Busca una salida, un ma√±ana que. D√© una nueva vida a todo el mundo que. S√≥lo por dolor no se pierda en el camino. No te rindas nunca, busca en tu interior. Busca la salida, el ma√±ana que. Vuelves a tener dentro del valor que no se ve"

2,laura-pausini,Emergencia de Amor,"Sabes que te necesito. Es una emergencia de amor. Un sentimiento tan infinito. Que parece un inmenso dolor. No me preguntes que pasa. Es una emergencia de amor. Un canto l√≠bre que me traspasa. Hasta el fondo de mi coraz√≥n. Mi pan, mi vino. Una exigencia del destino. Una tormenta que atraviesa mi piel. Dulcemente.... me parte el alma. Yo te llevar√© siempre en mi bolsillo donde est√©. Como una moneda, un amuleto. Que yo con mis manos mecer√©. Esta pasi√≥n por tenerte. Es mi emergencia de amor. Sentirte cerca para nunca olvidarte. Conservar de tu boca el sabor. La noche, el d√≠a. En la tristeza en la alegr√≠a. Una batalla que no da tregua a mi ser. Dulcemente... me parte el alma. Yo te llevar√© siempre en mi bolsillo donde est√©. Como una moneda, un amuleto. Que yo entre mis manos guardar√©. Soy tu prisionera. T√∫, la evasi√≥n que crece en m√≠. Mi raz√≥n primera. Solamente junto a ti conocer√©. El amor que te dar√©. Yo te llevar√©. Siempre en mi bolsillo donde est√©. Llevo en mi secreto del hechizo. Que llena el vac√≠o de mi ser. Voy a seguirte a cada instante y te tendr√©. Siempre en bolsillo donde est√©. Como una moneda, un amuleto. Que yo entre mis manos guardar√©"

2,laura-pausini,En Cambio No,"Quiz√°s bastava respirar, s√≥lo respirar muy lento. Recuperar cada latido en m√≠. Y no tiene sentido ahora que no est√°s. ¬øAhora d√≥nde est√°s?. Porque yo no puedo acostumbrarme a√∫n. Diciembre ya lleg√≥, no est√°s aqu√≠. Yo te esperar√© hasta el fin. En cambio no, hoy no hay tiempo de explicarte. Ni preguntar si te am√© lo suficiente. Yo estoy aqu√≠ y quiero hablarte ahora, ahora. Porque se rompen en mis dientes. Las cosas importantes. Esas palabras que nunca escuchar√°s. Y las sumerjo en un lamento. Hacie. Haci√©ndolas salir, son todas para ti. Una por una aqu√≠. Las sientes ya. Pesan y se posaran entre nosotros dos. Si me faltas t√∫, no las puedo repetir. No las puedo pronunciar. En cambio no me llueven los recuerdos. De aquellos d√≠as que corr√≠amos al viento. Quiero so√±ar que puedo hablarte ahora, ahora. En cambio no, hoy no hay tiempo de explicarte. Tambi√©n ten√≠a yo mil cosas que contarte. Y frente a m√≠, mil cosas que me arrastran junto a ti. Quiz√°s bastava respirar, s√≥lo respirar muy lento. Hoy es tarde, hoy en cambio no"
2,laura-pausini,En La Puerta de Al Lado,"Por delante de mi casa. Cada d√≠a pasas t√∫. Con tu perro y con tus compras. Con tu camiseta azul. Corres r√°pido en la entrada. Llamas al mismo ascensor.

Que est√°s ah√≠. En la puerta de al lado. Me sorprendo incluso a mi. Y si me contento es s√≥lo por azar. A escondidas miro hacia ti. El tr√©bol de tu boca lo quiero para mi. Te he buscado en todas partes. Y estabas aqu√≠. Dime a donde vas. As√≠ de encantador. Que me disfrazar√°s. La realidad de f√°bulas. Un c√≥mplice ideal. Y no lo sabes ya. Que un d√≠a me querr√°s. Me esperar√°s. S√© que estar√°s. En la puerta de al lado. En la puerta de al lado, uuh. Y tu √∫nico defecto. Es no despertarte junto a mi. Dime a d√≥nde vas. As√≠ de encantador. Que me seducir√°s. Con la pasi√≥n y p√©talos de rosas. De cristal. Con esa ingenuidad. S√© que t√∫ estar√°s, me buscar√°s, me encontrar√°s. En la puerta de al lado. Donde te he encontrado. ¬øA d√≥nde vas t√∫?.

2,laura-pausini,En Los Jardines Donde Nadie Va,"Mira que arrugada esta esa piel. En su alma siente frio y ves. Ni las lagrimas que guarda en el. Hoy pueden caer. Otro dia tiene que pasar. Alegrias de otros que veras. Y este tiempo inconciliable que. Juega ya contra ti. Acabamos al final de pie. En una ventana para ver. Espectadores melancolicos. De felicidad improbable. Tantos viajes que quisiste hacer. Y ahora sabes que no puede ser. Un dolor que tu conoces bien. Solo el no te abandonara ya jamas. Te refugias en tu soledad. Mientras crece tu fragilidad. Los milagros ya no esperaras. Ahora ya no. Con mu√±ecos ya no hables mas. Y no toques esas pildoras. Esa monja es tan simpatica. Con las almas tiene practica. Te daria mi mirada. Para hacerte ver lo que quieras. La energia la alegria. Para regalarte sonrisas. Di que si siempre si. Y podras volar con mis alas. Donde tu sabes ya. Con tu corazon y sin penas. Hacer brillar de nuevo el sol. Para que el invierno se vaya. Curarte las heridas y. Darte dientes para que comas. Y luego verte sonreir. Luego verte correr de nuevo. Olvida ya. Hay quien se olvidara. De llevar una flor. Pasar un sabado. Despues silencios. Despues silencios... Silencios. En los jardines donde nadie va. Se respira la inutilidad. Hay respeto y limpieza pura. Es casi locura. Es tan bello abrazarte aqui. Defenderte y luchar por ti. Y vestirte y peinarte asi. Y susurrarte: no te rindas no. En los jardines donde nadie va. Cuanta vida cuanta soledad. Los achaques crecen dia a dia. Somos nadie sin la fantasia. Sostenles tu abrazales. Te ruego no dejemos que caigan. Esiles, fragiles tu cari√±o. Nunca les niegues. Estrellas que ahora no se ven. Pero dan sentido a este cielo. Los hombres no pueden brillar. Si no brillan tambien por ellos. Manos que ahora temblaran. Porque el viento sopla mas fuerte. No les dejes ahora no. Que no les sorprenda la muerte. Somos egoistas cuando en vez. De ayudar nos negamos. Olvida ya. Hay quien se olvidara. De llevar una flor. Pasar un sabado. Despues silencios. Despues silencios... Silencios"

No es que te importa. No es me da igual. No es convencerse de que todo vale. No es llegara viejo. Cambiando canales. Oir y prestar atencion. Embriagarse de amor. Es una fijacion. Y el oficio que lijo. De la tinta cerrada. Al papel en que escribo. Hacerme mas digna. Es por lo que vivo. No es la victoria el aplauso del mundo. De lo que sucede el sentido profundo. No es....

Every little thing you do. When you look at me that way. Oh it moves me. When you take my hand the love goes right through me. And the reason that it feels so good.

You're the half that makes me whole. The only one who seizes my soul. Baby it's so real but still I can't believe. Every little thing that you do to me. When you take my hands. I like it. Oh I Like it. When you listen to my heart. Oh I like it. I like it. Even in the night when you're not here with me. My sweetest dreams still take me to. Every little thing you do. You're the rhythm in my song. You're the switch that turns me on. The only place where I belong and or want to be. You're the heaven that makes me hope. The only one who seizes my soul. Baby it's so real but still I can't believe. You're the rhythm in my song. You're the switch that turns me on. The only place where I belong and want to be with you. You're the heaven that makes me hope. The only one who seizes my soul. Baby it's so real but still I can't believe. Every little thing you do to me. I Like it. I like it. Every little thing. I like it.
2,laura-pausini,Everyday Is A Monday,"Feels like I¬¥ve been frozen in time. And I¬¥m looking for an easy way. To get on with my life. But I know, you¬¥re the one to tell. I¬¥ve been putting on a masquerade. I ain¬¥t doing that well. Everything has crashed. And I¬¥m losing this game. Can¬¥t help myself but wonder. Do you feel the same?. How could I ever say goodbye. Everyday is a Monday. Without you by my side. I must have been a fool to try. Everyday is a Monday. Without you in my life. Tell me, it¬¥s a big mistake. ¬¥Cause I kinda I learned my lesson. More than I can take. Freedom, had a price to pay. I don¬¥t want to be the one. To throw it all away. Everything has crashed. And I¬¥m losing this game. Can¬¥t help myself but wonder. Do you feel the same?. (Chorus). We were the weekend always living to be free. Now I¬¥m stuck here on Monday, when I need you every day of the week. Everything has crashed. And I¬¥m losing this game. Can¬¥t help myself but wonder. Do you feel the same?. (Chorus)"

E del coraggio che appartiene. Achi non √® andato via, mai via. Crediamo ancora nei detagli. Le cose semplice e i risvegli. Che cambiano il mondo, in ogni secondo. Noi siamo qui per ascoltarci. E siamo fatti per amarci. Come vuoi tu, come sei tu. Fai quello che sei. Fallo con orgoglio. E dove stai andando arriverai. Cos√¨ ti voglio. Fai quello che sei. Quando fa pi√π male.

We stop existing and start living. The it feels that always. Love's enough for us growing. So make a better world. Make a better place. Heal the world. Make it a better place. For you and for me. And the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living. Make a better place for you and for me. And the dream we were conceived in. Will reveal a joyful face. And the world we once believed in. Will shine again in grace. Then why do we keep strangling life. Wound this earth, crucify its soul. Though it's plain to see. This world is heavenly. Be god's glow. We could fly so high. Let our spirits never die. In my heart I feel you are all my brothers. Create a world with no fear. Together we cry happy tears. See the nations turn their swords into plowshares. We could really get there. If you cared enough for the living. Make a little space. To make a better place. Heal the world. Make it a better place. For you and for me. And the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living. Make a better place for you and for me. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living. Make a better place for you and for me. You and for me"

With candy canes and silver lanes aglow. It's beginning to look a lot like christmas. Toys in every store. But the prettiest sight to see. Is the holly that will be. On your own front door. A pair of hopalong boots. And a pistol that shoots. Is the wish of barney and ben. Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk. Is the hope of janice and jen. And mom and dad can hardly wait. For school to start again. It's beginning to look a lot like christmas. Everywhere you go. There's a tree in the grand hotel. One in the park as well. The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow. It's beginning to look a lot like christmas. Soon the bells will start. And the thing that will make them. Ring is the carol that you sing. Right within your heart. It's beginning to look a lot like christmas. Toys in every store. But the prettiest sight to see. Is the holly that will be. On your own front door. So it's christmas once more

Ha detto un giorno tu mi capirai. Chiss√† se tu mi penserai. Se con gli amici parlerai. Per non soffrire pi√π per me. Ma non √® facile lo sai. A scuola non ne posso pi√π. E i pomeriggi senza te.

E per questo ci sono. Sono mani bagnate. Sono lacrime uscite. Ho paura e non temo. Questo cambio di tempo. Per natura mi spingo. Per vedere se vinco. C'√® qualcosa che vola. Lato destro del cuore.

Son sicura. Mi addormento e vengo a prenderti ora. Camminiamo sull'acqua. Poi mangiamo per strada. E giochiamo a star bene. Ho paura e ti amo. E per questo ti dono. Accarezzami adesso. Per sentire chi sono. Ho paura e ritocco. Do pi√π luce alla foto. Buona luce e buon viaggio. Non dimentico niente. E per questo mi salvo. Perch√© ho direzione. Voglio dirti che ho vinto. Voglio dirti ti amo. C'√® qualcosa che vola. Lato destro del cuore

E posso solo pensare che ho gi√† vinto se convinco te. Che sei speciale. Come le cose che non mi aspetto. Come quel grazie che arriva dritto. O quell'abbraccio che non smette mai. Di dare affetto.

E chi ti batte le mani. Perch√© fa suo quello che sei. Posso soltanto tornare dove ancora stai aspettando tu. E quel che ho avuto, restituire e lasciarlo a te. Che sei speciale.

Le mani sul cuscino. I tuoi occhi su di me. Li ho cercati da lontano. Quando ho capito che di me. Hai visto l'invisibile. Guardami. Se non ti sento, ascoltami. Se sto in silenzio, resta qui. Se tutto il bene che ti ho dato ancora esiste. Scusami. Se non ti ho capito, aiutami. Sono qui per questo, abbracciami. Perch√© vedo ancora luce in quelle due finestre. Due finestre. Ho avuto tanto e di pi√π. Ma tra le cose che ho. Non ho trovato rifugio. Non l'ho trovato per√≤. Si dice che il destino. Perdona solo se. Al di l√† di ci√≤ che abbiamo. Conta se ami ed il perch√©. Conta chi ami ed il perch√©. Guardami. Se non ti sento, ascoltami. Se sto in silenzio, resta qui. Se tutto il bene consumato ancora esiste. Scusami. Se non ti ho capito, aiutami. E se poi mi perdo, abbracciami. Perch√© vedo ancora luce in quelle due finestre. Ma sono cos√¨ fragile. Sento in mezzo al panico. L'assenza che mi assale. Non sai quanto √® difficile. Perdersi tra immagine di un letto. Dove non ti trovo mai. Mai. Guardami. Se non sto a sentire, ascoltami. Finch√© c'√® silenzio, resta qui. √à una notte complicata ma soltanto nostra. E scusami. Se non ti capisco, aiutami. Sono qui per questo, abbracciami. Perch√© vedo ancora luce in quelle due finestre. E guardami. Se amore √® sempre amore in fondo poi resiste. Guardami. E se ti cerco, ascoltami. Sono qui per questo, abbracciami. Tutto il bene che hai provato. Ancora esiste"

Prendi il sorriso e questa faccia. Accarezzali piano piano. Con un gesto della mano. Come quando ero bambina. E per starti pi√π vicina. Mi mettevo a gridare. Solo per farmi guardare da te. Come quando ero bambina. E per starti pi√π vicina. Mi mettevo a cantare. Solo per farmi guardare da te, da te. Da te, da te. Lo sapevi prima tu. E adesso guardami nella tua vita. Lo sapevi prima tu. Che mi hai concepita"
2,laura-pausini,Lo Siento,"Mam√°, he so√±ado que llamabas a mi puerta. un poco tensa y con la gafas empa√±adas,. quer√≠as verme bien y fue la vez primera,. sent√≠a que sab√≠as como te a√±oraba.. Y me abrazaste mientras te maravillabas. de que aguantara triste y casi sin aliento,. hace ya tanto que no estamos abrazadas. y en el silencio me dijiste...¬°lo siento!.. Pero ha bastado un ruido para despertarme,. para llorar y para hacer que regresara. a aquellos d√≠as que de ni√±a me cuidabas. donde en verano cielo y playa se juntaban.. Mientras con mi mu√±eca vieja te escuchaba. los cuentos que t√∫ cada noche me contabas. y cuando m√°s peque√±a t√∫ me acurrucabas. y adormecida en tu regazo yo so√±aba.. Pero a los diecis√©is sent√≠ como cambiaba,. y como soy realmente ahora me ve√≠a,. y me sent√≠ tan sola y tan desesperada. porque yo no era ya la hija que quer√≠a.. Y fue el final as√≠ de nuestra confianza. de las peque√±as charlas que ayudaban tanto,. yo me escond√≠ tras una g√©lida impaciencia,. y t√∫ deseaste el hijo que se te ha negado.. Y me pasaba el d√≠a sin volver a casa,. no soportaba tus sermones para nada,. y comenc√© a volverme yo tambi√©n celosa,. porque eras casi inalcanzable, tan hermosa.. Y abandon√© mi sue√±o a falta de equipaje,. mi coraz√≥n al mar tir√© en una vasija,. perd√≠ hasta la memoria por falta de coraje,. porque me avergonzaba tanto ser tu hija.. No, no, no, no, no.. Mas no llamaste t√∫ a mi puerta,. in√∫tilmente tuve un sue√±o que no. puede realizarse,. mi pensamiento est√° tan lleno del presente. que mi orgullo no me deja perdonarme.. Mas si llamases a mi puerta en otro sue√±o,. no lograr√≠a pronunciar una palabra,. me mirar√≠as con tu gesto tan severo. y yo me sentir√≠a cada vez mas sola.. Por eso estoy en esta carta tan confusa,. para econtrar algo de paz en lo que pienso,. no para reclamarte ni pedirte excusas,. es solo para decirte, mama...¬°lo siento!.. Y no es verdad que yo me sienta. avergonzada,. son nuestra almas tan igual, tan parecidas. esperar√© pacientemente aqu√≠ sentada,. te quiero tanto mama...escr√≠beme...tu hija."
2,laura-pausini,Looking For An Angel,Well I'm looking for an angel. Someone to watch over me. Someone to lean on my shoulder. I wanna feel how love can be. But these things they don't come easy. I've learned my lesson well. Some things don't work the way you planned. Sometimes you just can't tell. So I'm looking for an angel. Someone to let you know my love for you. Seems I've never felt this way before. I never wanted to see just what love can do. But these things they don't come easy. I've learned my lesson well. When things don't work the way you planned. You need someone to tell. You are my paradise. The source of my desires. I believe in you so much. I'm longing for your touch. I need you by my side. So all my dreams will fly. I can't live this way because I know. I cry alone. I fear to cry alone alone. So what will I do without you. Who will I see when I close my eyes. I can't face another night alone without you here. Cause I can't face the night. Without you here. Alone without you here. Sometimes you just can't tell. You are my paradise. The source of my desires I believe in you so much. I'm waiting. Here for your touch. I need you by my side so with my dreams I can touch the sky. I can't live this way cause this time I know. I cry alone. I fear to cry here alone. So I'm looking for an angel I'm looking for you

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes. Your Spanish lullaby. Y mi banda toca el rock. Y lo demas cuando lo piden. Sabemos bien que aqui. Hacer de todo lo exigen. Y es un rock bambino. Un sabor mas bien latino. Esta musica es esperanza. Esta musica es pasion. Si es como un tren que ha pasado. Con un cargo de emociones. Nos pas√≥ en la estaci√≥n. Pero dorm√≠amos sentados. Y mi banda toca el rock. Por que nos ve y porque no puede. Y porque falta reir. Por correr tras su quimera. Y no despierten no, no, no, todavia no. Y no nos paren no, no, no, todavia no. Y mi banda toca el rock. Y cambia cada cuando lo piden. Desde que entras el mismo. Casi siempre lo exigen. Lo esperan en la colina. Con la musica latina. Nos veran tambien bailando. Y mil vueltas van buscando. Nos espera en la frontera. Con el auto bloqueado. Mas el rock habra pasado. Y la musica ha llegado. Es un rock, bambino. Un sabor mas bien latino. Y asi su pasaporte. Lo seguimos corriendo fuerte. Que penetra en los muros. Hace brecha en la puerta. Hasta el fondo el te dice. Que tu alma no esta muerta. Y no despierten no, no, no, todavia no. Y no nos paren no, no, no, todavia no. Y mi banda toca el rock. Es una eterna salida. Llega bien en ondas medias. Y en frecuencia modulada. Es un rock san siro. Un sabor mas bien latino. Esta musica es esperanza. Esta musica es pasion. Si es como un tren que ha pasado. Con un cargo de emociones. Nos paso en la estacion. Pero dorm√≠amos sentados. Y mi banda toca el rock. Por que nos ve y porque no puede. Y porque falta reir. Por correr tras su quimera. Y no despierten no, no, no, todavia no. Y no nos paren no, no, no, todavia no. Y no despierten no, no, no, todavia no. Y no nos paren no, no, no, todavia no. Tropical the island breeze. All of nature wild and free. Ah ah ah ah ah ah. And when the samba played.

2,laura-pausini,Mi Dispiace,Mamma ho sognato che bussavi alla mia porta. E un po' smarrita ti toglievi i tuoi occhiali. Ma per vedermi meglio e per la prima volta. Sentivo che sentivi che non siamo uguali. Ed abbracciandomi ti sei meravigliata. Che fossi cos√¨ triste e non trovassi pace. Da quanto tempo non ti avevo pi√π abbracciata. E in quel silenzio ho detto piano... mi dispiace!. Per√≤ √® bastato quel rumore per svegliarmi. Per farmi piangere e per farmi ritornare. Alla mia infanzia a tutti quei perduti giorni. Dove d'estate il cielo diventava mare. Ed io con le mie vecchie bambole ascoltavo. Le fiabe che tu raccontavi a bassa voce. E quando tra le tue braccia io mi addormentavo. Senza sapere ancora di essere felice.. Ma a sedici anni io per√≤ sono cambiata. E com'ero veramente adesso mi vedevo. E mi senti ad un tratto sola e disperata. Perch√© non ero pi√π la figlia che volevo. Ed √® finita li la nostra confidenza. Quel piccolo parlare che era un grande aiuto. Io mi nascosi in una gelida impazienza. E tu avrai rimpianto il figlio che non hai avuto.. Ormai passavo tutto il tempo fuori casa. Non sopportavo le tue prediche per nulla. E incominciai a diventare anche gelosa. Perch√© eri grande irraggiungibile e pi√π bella. Mi regalai cos√¨ ad un sogno di passaggio. Buttai il mio cuore in mare dentro una bottiglia. E persi la memoria mancando di coraggio. Perch√© mi vergognavo di essere tua figlia!. Ma tu non bussi alla mia porta e inutilmente. Ho fatto un sogno che non posso realizzare. Perch√© ho il pensiero troppo pieno del mio niente. Perch√© l'orgoglio non mi vuole perdonare. Poi se bussassi alla mia porta per davvero. Non riuscirei nemmeno a dirti una parola. Mi parleresti col tuo sguardo un po' severo. Ed io mi sentirei un'altra volta sola.. Perci√≤ ti ho scritto questa lettera confusa. Per ritrovare almeno in me un po' di pace. E non per chiederti tardivamente scusa. Ma per riuscire a dirti mamma... mi dispiace!. Non √® pi√π vero che di te io mi vergogno. E la mia anima lo sento ti assomiglia. Aspetter√≤ pazientemente un altro sogno.. Ti voglio bene mamma... scrivimi... tua figlia

Ahora se que ya mi respuesta encontr√©,. amor, si... t√∫.. He querido sin lograrme decidir,. -Coraz√≥n de n√≥mada-. Cada fuego era una llama ef√≠mera. Y mi huella una se√±al mil√©sima.. He vivido en el seno de la apat√≠a,. Y mi tiempo guardo en un ba√∫l,. Mi trinchera fu√© mi triste soledad. He rogado que llegaras t√∫.. Imagin√°ndome otra vida junto a t√≠,. De hermosos d√≠as f√°ciles. Y cu√°ntas veces al espejo pregunt√©. En donde est√° el amor que yo so√±√©.. Ahora se que mi respuesta eres t√∫,. Porque vivo de t√≠.. No ser√© nunca la misma porque. Tendr√© tu amor para m√≠.. Me lleg√≥, con esto me basta, saber. Que yo no dudo de t√≠.. Como un c√≠rculo que el agua abriendo va,. Como ele alba que comienza a despertar,. La tierra de mi mundo tengo en t√≠,. Las cosas tienen ya sentido as√≠.. Las dudas a m√≠,. Ahora se que mi respuesta eres t√∫,. Porque t√∫ vives en m√≠.. Ahora se que no hay m√°s respuesta, que no,. Porque yo vivo de t√≠, vivo de t√≠."

Disfo le valigie e chiamo le mie amiche e poi. ho ancora da studiare ed io che cerco te in quelle pagine. Da domani tutto come sempre torner√†. La gente il traffico in citt√†. Non voglio amare pi√π cos√¨. Come vorrei odiarti farti anche del mare, ma. vorrei soltanto averti qui con me non voglio amare pi√π cos√¨. Io senza te che vita √®. Ogni sera esco e tu sei li che guardi me. Da quella foto al mare ed io ti chiuderei in una scatola. Mi ha telefonato quella che non amolla mai. ma se l'amassi forse io potrei con lei dimenticare te. Poi delle vacanze quanto se ne parler√†. Storie leggere dell'et√† non voglio amare pi√π cos√¨. Voglio anche scherzare non drammatizzare ma. pi√π parlo e pi√π ti vedo qui con me non voglio amare pi√π cos√¨. Io senza te che vita √®. Non voglio amare pi√π cos√¨."
2,laura-pausini,Mi Tengo,"Mi tengo molto pi√π di quel che perdo. Io lascio andare te ... Non il ricordo!!. Mi tengo gli anni .. quelli dell'incanto. Verranno gli altri poi .. te li racconto. Perch√® con te ho imparato che felici lo si √® senza un miracolo. Con te guardare dalla stessa parte .. era gi√† quello uno spettacolo. E poi ho capito che dorme di meno chi ama un po' di pi√π. Mi tengo certi brividi alla schiena ... Perch√® fermarli non ne val la pena. Mi tengo pure una ferita aperta. Di aver ragione .. cosa me ne importa?. Perch√® non c'√® una colpa da cercare .. se non c'√® nessun colpevole!. C'√® solo un'altra strada da trovare. Non c'√® il forte .. non il debole. Ma mentre tu dormivi .. io spiavo il cielo:. Vedevo stelle alzarsi sulle punte e buttarle su te. Fino a riempire la stanza della luce pi√π bella che c'√®. Fino a riempire la vita della luce pi√π bella. Mi tengo le cose che hai detto alla porta ... La fitta sul petto e i fiori di carta. Perch√® non c'√® una colpa .. c'√® una fine. E in mezzo il bene che rimane. Mi tengo la tua rabbia .. se ti pare. La mia, ti giuro, l'ho lasciata andare!. Se siamo stati parte di uno sbaglio ... A volte anche qualcosa di un po' meglio"

Gioie che non ti appartengono.. Questo tempo inconciliabile gioca contro di te.. Ecco come si finisce poi,. Inchiodati a una finestra noi,. Spettatori malinconici,. Di felicit√† impossibili.... Tanti viaggi rimandati e gi√†,. Valigie vuote da un'eternit√†.... Quel dolore che non sai cos'√®,. Solo lui non ti abbandoner√† mai, oh mai!. E' un rifugio quel malessere,. Troppa fretta in quel tuo crescere.. Non si fanno pi√π miracoli,. Adesso non pi√π.. Non dar retta a quelle bambole.. Non toccare quelle pillole.. Quella suora ha un bel carattere,. Ci sa fare con le anime.. Ti darei gli occhi miei,. Per vedere ci√≤ che non vedi.. L'energia, l'allegria,. Per strapparti ancora sorrisi.. Dirti si, sempre si,. E riuscire a farti volare,. Dove vuoi, dove sai,. Senza pi√π quei pesi sul cuore.. Nasconderti le nuvole,. Quell'inverno che ti fa male.. Curarti le ferite e poi,. Qualche dente in pi√π per mangiare.. E poi vederti ridere,. E poi vederti correre ancora.. Dimentica, c'√® chi dimentica. Distrattamente un fiore una domenica. E poi... silenzi. e poi silenzi.. Nei giardini che nessuno sa. Si respira l'inutilit√†.. C'√® rispetto grande pulizia,. √à quasi follia.. Non sai come √® bello stringerti,. Ritrovarsi qui a difenderti,. E vestirti e pettinarti si.. E sussurrarti non arrenderti. Nei giardini che nessuno sa,. Quanta vita si trascina qua,. Solo acciacchi, piccole anemie.. Siamo niente senza fantasie.. Sorreggili, aiutali,. Ti prego non lasciarli cadere.. Esili, fragili,. Non negargli un po' del tuo amore.. Stelle che ora tacciono,. Ma daranno un segno a quel cielo.. Gli uomini non brillano. Se non sono stelle anche loro.. E Mani che ora tremano,. Perch√© il vento soffia pi√π forte.... Non lasciarli adesso no.. Che non li sorprenda la morte.. Siamo noi gli inabili,. Che pure avendo a volte non diamo.. Dimentica, c'√® chi dimentica,.

[Chorus]. No river is wilder. Than my philosophy. Hold me that I'll be. A shelter for you. I won't let you let you doubt again. Because the truth is what I give. Come back to see your love for me. Promise me to be. The promise that I need. [Verse 2]. All of the wings. That I thought were bonded. That threw away. My whole damn world. Finally fly me. And finally save me. Right in time my heart can feel you next to me. Just next to me. [Chorus]. No river is wilder. Than my philosophy. Catch me then I'll be. A shelter for you. I'll let the dream come true. Because the truth is what I need. Come back to see your love for me. [Bridge]. No river is wilder. No reason is righter. I won't let you down again. Because the truth is what I give. Come back to see your love I need. Promise you to be. The promise that I need. [Outro]. All of the love. That I though I missed out. Has found its way. To warm the cold. Finally wants me. Finally saves me. Right in time my soul will love you. Eternally"

If I could hold you one more time. like in the days when you were mine. I'd look at you 'till I was blind. So you would stay. I'd say a prayer each time you'd smile. Cradle the moments like a child. I'd stop the world if only I. Could hold you one more time. (hmmmmmm). I've memorized your face. I know your touch by heart. Still lost in your embrace. I'd dream of where you are. (hmmm). If I could hold you one more time. Like in the days when you were mine. I'd look at you 'till I was blind. So you would stay. I'd say a prayer each time you'd smile. Cradle the moments like a child. I'd stop the world if only I. Could hold you one more time. One more time

Resta un mare che va e ha gi√† spazzato via. La tua,la mia perduta eternit√†. Che ormai non √® che sabbia a raffiche. Ricordami nel freddo di milano. Nei sandali di corse libere. Ricordami se non ti sembra strano rivivere quegli attimi con me. E ritorno naufraga nella stessa camera. E dormo qui senza di te come una stupida. E la vita va testarda pi√π di noi e non ha piet√† se adesso non mi vuoi. Ma tu che fai di questa libert√† che ormai per me. √® un vuoto inutile. Ricordami nel freddo di milano fra I mandorli di un paradiso blu. Ricordami non senti che ti chiamo non chiedermi di non amarti pi√π. E mi sveglio naufraga nella stessa camera. E scappo via lasciando qui quest'alba splendida. Ricordami. Ricordami ricorda da lontano ricorda chi non vuole perderti. Mentre il tempo corre via flash di una fotografia. Ho un regalo se mi vuoi la vita che verr√† per noi"

2,laura-pausini,White Christmas,I'm dreaming of a white christmas. Just like the ones I used to know. Where the treetops glisten. And children listen. To hear sleigh bells in the snow. Oh I'm dreaming of a white christmas. With every christmas card I write. May your days be merry and bright. And may all your christmases be white. Oh I'm dreaming of a white christmas. With every christmas card I write. May your days be merry and bright. And may all your christmases be white
2,laura-pausini,Without You,Close your eyes and say good night. And hold me till the morning light. When the sun comes shinning through. I'll kiss you one last time. And i'll begin to live my life without you. Wish that I could make you stay. But I know I have no power to persuade. The heart will do what it must do. So kiss me one last time. And tell me how to live my life without you. Cause I love you without and ending. Cause I need you to be my everything. Tell me the meaning of a life without you with me. When the night falls i'll still be standing. Cause you'll always be right here in my heart. And in my deepest memories. I will never have to be without you. Love is like a work of art. Once you feel it you hold it in your heart. You know forever that its true. So kiss me for always. Even if I live my life without you. Cause I love you without and ending. Cause I need you to be my everything. Tell me the meaning of a life without you with me. When the night falls i'll still be standing. Cause you'll always be right here in my heart. And in my deepest memories. I will never have to be without you
2,laura-pausini,Y Mi Banda Toca El Rock,"Y mi banda toca el rock. Y lo demas cuando lo piden. Sabemos bien que aqui. Hacer de todo lo exigen. Y es un rock bambino. Un sabor mas bien latino. Esta musica es esperanza. Esta musica es pasion. Si es como un tren que ha pasado. Con un cargo de emociones. Nos paso en la estacion. Pero dormiamos sentados. Y mi banda toca el rock. Por que nos ve y porque no puede. Y porque falta reir. Por correr tras su quimera. Y no despierten no, no, no, todavia no. Y no nos paren no, no, no, todavia no. Y mi banda toca el rock. Y cambia cada cuando lo piden. Desde que entras el mismo. Casi siempre lo exigen. Lo esperan en la colina. Con la musica latina. Nos veran tambien bailando. Y mil vueltas van buscando. Nos espera en la frontera. Con el auto bloqueado. Mas el rock habra pasado. La musica ha llegado. Es un rock, bambino. Un sabor mas bien latino. Y asi su pasaporte. Lo seguimos corriendo fuerte. Que penetra en los muros. Hace brecha en la puerta. Hasta el fondo el te dice. Que tu alma no esta muerta. Y no despierten no, no, no, todavia no. Y no nos paren no, no, no, todavia no. Y mi banda toca el rock. Es una eterna salida. Llega bien en ondas medias. Y en frecuencia modulada. Es un rock bambino. Un sabor mas bien latino. Esta musica es esperanza. Esta musica es pasion. Si es como un tren que ha pasado. Con un cargo de emociones. Nos paso en la estacion. Pero dorm√≠amos sentados. Y mi banda toca el rock. Por que nos ve y porque no puede. Y porque falta reir. Por correr tras su quimera. Y no despierten no, no, no, todavia no. Y no nos paren no, no, no, todavia no"

La almohada aun caliente guarda vida. Inciertos pasos lentos de una ni√±a. Los pasos de serenidad. La mano que se extender√°. La espera de felicidad. Por esto y por lo que vendr√°. Yo canto. Tranquilamente canto. La voz en fiesta, canto. La banda en fiesta, canto. Corriendo al viento. Canto. La vida entera canto. La primavera canto. Rezando tambi√©n canto. Alguien me escuchar√°. Quiero cantarle. Siempre cantarle. El aroma del caf√© en la cocina. La casa que se llena de alegr√≠a. El ascensor que no va. El amor a mi ciudad. La gente que sonreir√° son de mi calle. Las ramas que se cruzan hacia el cielo. Un viejo que camina en solitario. El verano que nos dejar√°. El trivo que madurar√°. La mano que lo acojer√°. Por esto y por lo que ser√°. Yo canto. Tranquilamente canto. La voz en fiesta, canto. La banda en fiesta, canto. Corriendo al viento. Canto. La vida entera canto. La primavera, canto. Rezando tambi√©n canto. Alguien me escuchar√°.

Somehow you found me. You took my hand when I was lost. Embraced me with your love. In your arms is where I belong. You are my shelter. My tears and laughter. The sunlight and the wind. You are my angel. You are the joy that love can bring. Love will grow and takes us high. Love has just begun. And I do believe nothing can bring us down. I can see it in your eyes. The fail will never fade. Cause in my heart I know. To be there beside you. To hold you when you're down and out. Embrace you with my love. Cause in my heart is where you belong. You are my shelter. My tears and laughter. The sunlight and the wind. You are my angel. You are the joy that love can bring. You are my everything. You are the joy that love can bring. Yes you are. Oh baby.

3,evanescence,My Immortal,"I'm so tired of being here. Suppressed by all my childish fears. And if you have to leave, I wish that you would just leave. 'Cause your presence still lingers here. And it won't leave me alone. These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. And I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me. You used to captivate me by your resonating light. Now I'm bound by the life you've left behind. Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams. Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me. These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. And I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me. I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone. But though you're still with me. I've been alone all along. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. And I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me"

3,evanescence,Imaginary,I linger in the doorway. Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name. Let me stay. Where the wind will whisper to me. Where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story. In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby. I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me. Don't say I'm out of touch. With this rampant chaos - your reality. I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge. The nightmare I built my own world to escape. In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby. I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me. Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming. Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights. Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming. The goddess of imaginary light. In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby. I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me

And I've completely lost myself and I don't mind. I can't say no to you. Shouldn't have let you conquer me completely. Now I can't let go of this dream. Can't believe that I feel. Good enough. I feel good enough. It's been such a long time coming, but I feel good. And I'm still waiting for the rain to fall. Pour real life down on me. Cause I can't hold on to anything this. Good enough. Am I good enough. For you to love me too?. So take care what you ask of me. Cause I can't say no"

Hello, hello remember me?. I'm everything you can't control. Somewhere beyond the pain. There must be a way to believe. We can break through. Do what you what you want. You don't have to lay your life down (it isn't over). Do what you what you want. Till you find what you're looking for. (got to remember who you really are). But every hour. Slipping by. Screams that I have failed you. Hello, hello remember me?. I'm everything you can't control. Somewhere beyond the pain. There must be a way to believe. Hello, hello remember me?. I'm everything you can't control. Somewhere beyond the pain. There must be a way to believe. There's still time. Close your eyes. Only love will guide you home. Tear down the walls and free your soul. Till we crash we're forever spiraling down. Down, down, down. Hello, hello, it's only me. infecting everything you love. Somewhere beyond the pain. There must be a way to believe. Hello, hello remember me?. I'm everything you can't control. Somewhere beyond the pain. There must be a way to learn forgiveness. Hello, hello remember me?. I'm everything you can't control. Somewhere beyond the pain. There must be a way to believe. We can break through. Remember who you really are. DO what you what you want"
3,evanescence,Forgive Me,"Can you forgive me again?. I don't know what I said. But I didn't mean to hurt you. I heard the words come out. I felt that I would die. It hurt so much to hurt you. Then you look at me. You're not shouting anymore. You're silently broken. I'd give anything now. to kill those words for you. Each time I say something I regret I cry I don't want to lose you.. But somehow I know that you will never leave me, yeah.. 'Cause you were made for me. Somehow I'll make you see. How happy you make me. I can't live this life. Without you by my side. I need you to survive. So stay with me. You look in my eyes and I'm screaming inside then I'm sorry.. And you forgive me again. You're my one true friend. And I never meant to hurt you"
3,evanescence,Haunted,Long lost words whisper slowly to me. Still can't find what keeps me here. When all this time I've been so hollow inside. I know you're still there. Watching me wanting me. I can feel you pull me down. Fearing you loving you. I won't let you pull me down. Hunting you I can smell you - alive. Your heart pounding in my head. Watching me wanting me. I can feel you pull me down. Saving me raping me. Watching me. I won't let you pull me down. Watching me wanting me. I can feel you pull me down. Saving me raping me. Watching me. I won't let you pull me down
3,evanescence,Lacrymosa,"Out on your own. Cold and alone again. Can this be what you really wanted, baby?. Blame it on me. Set your guilt free. Nothing can hold you back now. Now that you're gone. I feel like myself again. Grieving the things I can't repair and willing.... To let you blame it on me. And set your guilt free. I don't want to hold you back now love. I can't change who I am. Not this time, I won't lie to keep you near me. And in this short life. There's no time to waste on giving up. My love wasn't enough. And you can blame it on me. Just set your guilt free, honey. I don't want to hold you back now love. (Lacrimosa dies illa,. Qua resurget ex favilla judicandus homo reus.. Huic ergo parce, Deus.. Pie Jesu, domine dona eis requiem. Am√©n)"
3,evanescence,Imperfection,"The more you try to fight it. The more you try to hide it. The more infected, rejected, you feel alone inside it. You know you can't deny it. The world's a little more fucked up everyday. I'm gonna save you from it. Together we'll outrun it. Just don't give into the fear. So many things I would've told you. If I knew that I was never gonna see you again. I wanna lift you up. Into the light. That you deserve. I wanna take your pain. Into myself. So you won't hurt. Don't you dare surrender. Don't leave me here without you. 'Cause I could never. Replace your perfect imperfection. The way you look us over. Your counterfeit composure. Pushing again and again and sinking lower and lower. The world is on our shoulders. Do you really know the weight of the words you say?. You want a little of it. You just can't let go of it. You've got an ego to feed. Too late to rise above it. Don't look now but the little girl's got a grenade. I'm gonna lift you up. Into the light. That you deserve. I'm gonna take you down. To the real world. So you can watch it burn. Don't you dare surrender. Don't leave me here without you. 'Cause I could never. Replace your perfect imperfection. We stand undefined. Can't be drawn with a straight line. This will not be our ending. We are alive, we are alive. Don't you dare surrender. Don't leave me here without you. 'Cause I could never. Replace your perfect imperfection. Don't you dare surrender. I'm still right beside you. And I could never. Replace your perfect imperfection"
3,evanescence,Whisper,"Catch me as I fall. Say you're here and it's all over now. Speaking to the atmosphere. No one's here and I fall into myself. This truth drives me into madness. I know I can stop the pain if I will it all away. If I will it all away. Don't turn away. [Don't give in to the pain]. Don't try to hide. [Though they're screaming your name]. Don't close your eyes. [God knows what lies behind them]. Don't turn out the light. [Never sleep, never die]. I'm frightened by what I see. But somehow I know that there's much more to come. Immobilized by my fear. And soon to be blinded by tears. I can stop the pain if I will it all away. If I will it all away. Don't turn away. [Don't give in to the pain]. Don't try to hide. [Though they're screaming your name]. Don't close your eyes. [God knows what lies behind them]. Don't turn out the light. [Never sleep, never die]. Fallen angels at my feet. Whispered voices at my ear. Death before my eyes. Lying next to me I fear. She beckons me shall I give in. Upon my end shall I begin. Forsaking all I've fallen for I rise to meet the end. Don't turn away. [Don't give in to the pain]. Don't try to hide. [Though they're screaming your name]. Don't close your eyes. [God knows what lies behind them]. Don't turn out the light. [Never sleep never die]"
3,evanescence,Lost In Paradise,"I've been believing. In something so distant. As if I was human. And I've been denying. This feeling of hopelessness. In me, in me. All the promises I made. Just to let you down. You believed in me, but I'm broken. I have nothing left. And all I feel is this cruel wanting. We've been falling for all this time. And now I'm lost in paradise. As much as I'd like. The past not to exist. It still does. As much as I'd like. To feel like I belong here. I'm just as scared as you. I have nothing left. And all I feel is this cruel wanting. We've been falling for all this time. And now I'm lost in paradise. Run away, run away. One day we won't feel this pain anymore. Take it all away. Shadows of you. 'Cause they won't let me go. Till I have nothing left. And all I feel is this cruel wanting. We've been falling for all this time. And now I'm lost in paradise. Alone and lost in paradise"
3,evanescence,Taking Over Me,You don't remember me but I remember you. I lie awake and try so hard not to think of you. But who can decide what they dream?. And dream I do.... I believe in you. I'll give up everything just to find you. I have to be with you to live to breathe. You're taking over me. Have you forgotten all I know. And all we had?. You saw me mourning my love for you. And touched my hand. I knew you loved me then. I believe in you. I'll give up everything just to find you. I have to be with you to live to breathe. you're taking over me. I look in the mirror and see your face. If i look deep enough. So many things inside that are just like you are taking over. believe in you. I'll give up everything just to find you. I have to be with you to live to breathe. You're taking over me
3,evanescence,4th Of July,Shower in the dark day. Clean sparks driving down. Cool in the waterway. Where the baptized drown. Naked in the cold sun. Breathing life like fire. Thought I was the only one. But that was just a lie. Cause I heard it in the wind. And I saw it in the sky. And I thought it was the end. And I thought it was the 4th of July. Pale in the flare light. The scared light cracks & disappears. And leads the scorched ones here. And everywhere no one cares. The fire is spreading. And no one wants to speak about it. Down in the hole. Jesus tries to crack a smile. Beneath another shovel load. And I heard it in the wind. And I saw it in the sky. And I thought it was the end. And I thought it was the 4th of July. Now I'm in control. Now I'm in the fall out. Once asleep but now I stand. And I still remember. Your sweet everything. Light a Roman candle. And hold it in your hand. Cause I heard it in the wind. And I saw it in the sky. And I thought it was the end. And I thought it was the 4th of July
3,evanescence,All That I'm Living For,All that I'm living for. All that I'm dying for. All that I can't ignore alone at night. I can feel the night beginning. Separate me from the living. Understanding me. After all I've seen. Piecing every thought together. Find the words to make me better. If I only knew how to pull myself apart. All that I'm living for. All that I'm dying for. All that I can't ignore alone at night. All that I'm wanted for. Although I wanted more. Lock the last open door. My ghosts are gaining on me. I believe that dreams are sacred. Take my darkest fears and play them. Like a lullaby. Like a reason why. Like a play of my obsessions. Make me understand the lesson. So I'll find myself. So I wont be lost again. All that I'm living for. All that I'm dying for. All that I can't ignore alone at night. All that I'm wanted for. Although I wanted more. Lock the last open door. My ghosts are gaining on me. Guess I thought I'd have to change the world. To make you see me. To be the one. I could have run forever. But how far would I have come. Without mourning your love?. All that I'm living for. All that I'm dying for. All that I can't ignore alone at night. All that I'm wanted for. Although I wanted more. Lock the last open door. My ghosts are gaining on me. Should it hurt to love you?. Should I feel like I do?. Should I lock the last open door?. My ghosts are gaining on me
3,evanescence,All That I'm Living For (traducci√≥n),"Todo por lo que vivo. Todo por lo que muero. Todo lo que no puedo ignorar, sola a la noche. Puedo sentir la noche comenzando.

I take a breath and I try to draw from my spirits well. Yet again you refuse to drink. Like a stubborn child. Lie to me convince me that I've been sick forever. And all of this will make sense when I get better. But I know the difference between myself and my reflection. I just can't help but to wonder which of us do you love. So I bleed. I bleed.

You can't play the victim this time. And you're too late. So don't cry to me. If you loved me. You would be here with me. You want me, come find me. Make up your mind. You never call me when you're sober. You only want it cause it's over. It's over. How could I have burned paradise?. How could I?. You were never mine. So don't cry to me. If you loved me. You would be here with me. Don't lie to me. Just get your things. I've made up your mind"
3,evanescence,Cartoon Network,"I'm Robbie's sister. I guess that's plain to see. When we watch Cartoon cartoons. I'm happy as can be. I think Samurai Jack's cool. And Dexter's Laboratory. I miss watching Powerpuff. I miss watching TV. Well, living on a tour bus ain't that bad. But I feel like I lost all that I had. On Cartoon Network. I miss you so. On Cartoon Network. Where did you go?. Grim and Evil, how I love that little brain. Johnny Bravo, can I smack you once again?. I hope you've learned a lesson here. Treasure what you have. Don't make the mistake I made. The rockstar life is sad. Well, living on a tour bus is pretty bad. And now I'm sure I know. The meaning of my life. The love within my soul. The reason I wake up each day and it's. Cartoon Network. I miss you so. My Cartoon Network. Where did you go?. My Cartoon Network"
3,evanescence,Cloud Nine,"If you want to live, let live. if you want to go, let go. I'm not afraid to dream- to sleep, sleep forever. I don't need to touch the sky. I just want to feel that high. And you refuse to lift me. Guess it wasn't real after all. Guess it wasn't real all along. If I fall and all is lost. It's where I belong. If you want to live, let live. If you want to go, let go. I'm never gonna be your sweet, sweet surrender. Guess it wasn't real after all. Guess it wasn't real all along. If I fall and all is lost. No light to lead the way. (Never thought that it would end up this way). Remember that all alone is where I belong. In a dream. Will you give your love to me?. Beg my broken heart to beat. Save my life. Change my mind. If I fall and all is lost. No light to lead the way. (Never thought that it would end up this way). Remember that all alone is where I belong"
3,evanescence,Disappear,"Hollow, like you don't remember me. Underneath everything I guess I always dreamed. That I would be the one to take you away. From all this wasted pain. But I can't save you from yourself. Don't you want to feel?. Don't you want to live your life?. How much longer are you gonna give into the fear?. Holding you down until you're. Frozen, I can't let you fall apart. You don't even know what you've done to me. But I would be the one to take you away. From all this wasted pain. If you could just wake up. Don't you want to feel?. Don't you want to live your life?. How much longer are you gonna give into the fear?. Holding you down until you're. All alone, all alone and drowning in your past. Take it back, take it back. I still believe you can. Don't you want to feel?. Don't you want to live your life?. How much longer are you gonna give into the fear?. I can't go on pretending so give me something real. No one in your way but you. How much longer are you gonna give into the fear?. Holding you down 'till you disappear"
3,evanescence,End Of The Dream,I found a grave. Brushed off the face. Felt your light. And I remember why I know this place. I found a bird. Closing her eyes. One last time. And I wonder if she dreamed like me. As much as it hurts ain't it wonderful to feel?. So go on and break your wings. Follow your heart till it bleeds. As we run towards the end of the dream. I'm not afraid. I push through the pain. And I'm on fire. I remember how to breathe again. As much as it hurts ain't it wonderful to feel?. So go on and bring your wings. Follow your heart till it bleeds. As we run towards the end of the dream. Why must we fall apart to understand how to fly?. I will find a way even without wings. Follow your heart till it bleeds. As we run towards the end of the dream. Follow your heart till it bleeds. And we've come to the end of the dream
3,evanescence,Erase This,It's too late to change your mind. Even though this fragile world. Is tearing apart at the seams. I can't wash these sins away. This sinking feeling everyday. I'm waking up with someone else's life. Is it so hard for you?. 'Cause it's so hard for me. To believe that what we dreamed. Could ever come to life again. 'Cause I cannot erase this lie. I'm not gonna let this day go by. I'm gonna save this wasted life. And nothing can stand in my way. Not enough to say goodbye. Burn it till there's nothing left. I'm drowning in the mess that i have made. Is it so hard for you?. 'Cause it's so hard for me. To believe that what we dreamed. Could ever come to life again. 'Cause I cannot erase this dark in me. The water's rising around us. There is no other way down. I only have myself to blame For it all. Is it so hard for you?. 'Cause it's so hard for me. To believe that what we dreamed. Could ever come to life again. If I could just erase my mind. But i cannot erase this lie

3,evanescence,Exodus,"My black backpack's stuffed with broken dreams. Twenty bucks should get me through the week. Never said a word of discontentment. Thought it a thousand times but now. I'm leaving home. Here in the shadows. I'm safe, I'm free. I've nowhere else to go. but I cannot stay where I don't belong. Two months passed by and it's getting cold. I know I'm not lost I'm just alone. But I won't cry, I won't give up, I can't go back now. Waking up is knowing who you really are. Here in the shadows. I'm safe, I'm free. I've nowhere else to go. but I cannot stay where I don't belong. In the shadows. I'm safe, I'm free. I've nowhere else to go. but I cannot stay here. Oh, show me the shadow where true meaning lies. So much more dismay in empty eyes."

3,evanescence,Field Of Innocence,"I still remember the world. From the eyes of a child. Slowly those feelings. Were clouded by what I know now. Where has my heart gone?. An uneven trade for the real world. Oh, I, I want to go back to. Believing in everything and knowing nothing at all. I still remember the sun. Always warm on my back. Somehow it seems colder now. Where has my heart gone?. Trapped in the eyes of a stranger. Oh, I, I want to go back to. Believing in everything. [Latin hymn:]. Iesu, Rex admirabiis. Et triumphator nobilis. Dulcu ineffabilis. Totus desiderabilis. [man:]. As the years pass by before my face. As wars rage before me. Finding myself in these last days of existence. This parasite inside me, I forced it out. In the darkness of the storm lies an evil. but it's me. Where has my heart gone?. An uneven trade for the real world. Oh, I, I want to go back to. Believing in everything.

The faster you were running. You don't know how it feels. Crawling under your skin. So far, so far away. Don't you know we could be. High or low. You never fell beneath me. And I gave up on you. But I never forgot you. I can't be your friend. Hold your hand while you bleed. There's nothing left to give you. Nothing more I need. Time to let it sleep. Oh, the damage was real. But nothing cut me so deep. I could not heal. Don't you know we could be. High or low. You never fell beneath me. And I gave up on you. But I never forgot you. High or low. You never fell beneath me.

3,evanescence,Imaginary,I linger in the doorway. Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name. Let me stay. Where the wind will whisper to me. Where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story. In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby. I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me. Don't say I'm out of touch. With this rampant chaos - your reality. I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge. The nightmare I built my own world to escape. In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby. I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me. Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming. Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights. Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming. The goddess of imaginary light. In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby. I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me
3,evanescence,Imaginary (original Version),"Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming. Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights. Oh, how I long for the deep sleep dreaming. The goddess of imaginary light. In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby (paper flowers). I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me (paper flowers). I linger in the doorway of alarm clock screaming. Monsters calling my name. Let me stay. Where the wind will whisper to me. Where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story. If you need to leave the world you live in. Lay your head down and stay a while (paper flowers). Though you may not remember dreaming. Something waits for you to breathe again (paper flowers). In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby (paper flowers). I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me (paper flowers). . . [by:Gothika And L√©o]"
3,evanescence,Imaginary (Traducci√≥n),"Permanezco en la puerta. Del reloj gritando. Monstruos que gritan mi nombre. D√©jenme permanecer. En donde el viento me susurrar√°. En donde las gotas de lluvia. Mientras caen cuentan una historia. En mi campo de flores de papel. Y nubes de canci√≥n de cuna acarameladas. Me recuesto dentro de m√≠ durante horas. Y miro mi cielo p√∫rpura volando sobre m√≠. No me digas que estoy desconectada. De este caos rampante ‚Äì tu realidad. Se muy bien que hay mas all√° de mi refugio de ensue√±o. La pesadilla, cre√© mi propio mundo para escapar. En mi campo de flores de papel. Y nubes de canci√≥n de cuna acarameladas. Me recuesto dentro de m√≠ durante horas. Y miro mi cielo p√∫rpura volando sobre m√≠. Tragada por el sonido de mis gritos. Que no puede callarse por el miedo de las noches silenciosas. OH como espero por el profundo sue√±o. La Diosa de la luz imaginaria"
3,evanescence,Imperfection,"The more you try to fight it. The more you try to hide it. The more infected, rejected, you feel alone inside it. You know you can't deny it. The world's a little more fucked up everyday. I'm gonna save you from it. Together we'll outrun it. Just don't give into the fear. So many things I would've told you. If I knew that I was never gonna see you again. I wanna lift you up. Into the light. That you deserve. I wanna take your pain. Into myself. So you won't hurt. Don't you dare surrender. Don't leave me here without you. 'Cause I could never. Replace your perfect imperfection. The way you look us over. Your counterfeit composure. Pushing again and again and sinking lower and lower. The world is on our shoulders. Do you really know the weight of the words you say?. You want a little of it. You just can't let go of it. You've got an ego to feed. Too late to rise above it. Don't look now but the little girl's got a grenade. I'm gonna lift you up. Into the light. That you deserve. I'm gonna take you down. To the real world. So you can watch it burn. Don't you dare surrender. Don't leave me here without you. 'Cause I could never. Replace your perfect imperfection. We stand undefined. Can't be drawn with a straight line. This will not be our ending. We are alive, we are alive. Don't you dare surrender. Don't leave me here without you. 'Cause I could never. Replace your perfect imperfection. Don't you dare surrender. I'm still right beside you. And I could never. Replace your perfect imperfection"

Not this time, I won't lie to keep you near me. And in this short life. There's no time to waste on giving up. My love wasn't enough. And you can blame it on me. Just set your guilt free, honey.

Nada puede sostenerte detr√°s ya. Ahora que te has ido. Me siento como yo misma de nuevo. Apenando las cosas que no puedo reparar y dispuesta. Para dejarte que me culpes. Y liberar tu culpa. No quiero sostenerte detr√°s ahora amor. No puedo cambiar. No esta vez, no mentir√© para mantenerte cerca de mi. Y en esta corta vida, no hay tiempo que perder rindi√©ndonos.

3,evanescence,Lies,"Bound at every limb by my shackles of fear. Sealed with lies through so many tears. Lost from within, pursuing the end. I fight for the chance to be lied to again. You will never be strong enough. You will never be good enough. You were never conceived in love. You will not rise above. [CHORUS:]. They'll never see. I'll never be. I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger. Burning deep inside of me. But through my tears breaks a blinding light. Birthing a dawn to this endless night. Arms outstretched, awaiting me. An open embrace upon a bleeding tree. Rest in me and I'll comfort you. I have lived and I died for you. Abide in me and I vow to you. I will never forsake you. They'll never see. I'll never be. I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger. Burning deep inside of me. They'll never see. I'll never be. I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger. Burning deep inside of me"

3,evanescence,Lies (traducci√≥n),"Atada a cada miembro por las trabas del miedo. Sellada por mentiras mediante muchas lagrimas. Perdida por dentro persiguiendo el final. Peleo por la oportunidad de ser mentida nuevamente. Nunca ser√°s lo suficientemente fuerte. Nunca ser√°s lo suficientemente bueno. Nunca ser√°s concebido con amor. Nunca te elevar√°s. Nunca ver√°n. Nunca ser√©. Pelear√© para alimentar mi hambre. Que me quema por dentro. Pero a trav√©s de mis l√°grimas atraviesa una luz cegadora. Dando a luz el final de esta noche eterna. Brazos abiertos me esperan. Un abrazo abierto sobre el √°rbol sangrante. Reposa sobre m√≠, te dar√© tranquilidad. He vivido y muerto por ti. Qu√©date conmigo y te adorar√©. Nunca te abandonar√©. Nunca ver√°n. Nunca ser√©. Pelear√© para alimentar mi hambre. Que me quema por dentro"
3,evanescence,Like You,"Stay low. Soft, dark, and dreamless. Far beneath my nightmares and loneliness. I hate me. For breathing without you. I don't want to feel anymore for you. Grieving for you. I'm not grieving for you. Nothing real love can't undo. And though I may have lost my way. All paths lead straight to you. I long to be like you. Lie cold in the ground like you. Halo. Blinding wall between us. Melt away and leave us alone again. Humming, haunted somewhere out there. I believe our love can see us through in death. I long to be like you. Lie cold in the ground like you. There's room inside for two and I'm not grieving for you. I'm coming for you. You're not alone. No matter what they told you you're not alone. I'll be right beside you forevermore. I long to be like you, sis. Lie cold in the ground like you dear. There's room inside for two and I'm not grieving for you. And as we lay in silent bliss. I know you remember me. I long to be like you. Lie cold in the ground like you. There's room inside for two and I'm not grieving for you. I'm coming for you"

Just to lose control, just once. With all the pretty flowers in the dust. Mary had a lamb. His eyes black as coals. If we play very quiet, my lamb. Mary never has to know. Just once in my life. I think it'd be nice. Just to lose control, just once. If I cut you down to a thing I can use. I fear there will be nothing good left of you"

Just to let you down. You believed in me, but I'm broken. I have nothing left. And all I feel is this cruel wanting. We've been falling for all this time. And now I'm lost in paradise. As much as I'd like. The past not to exist. It still does. As much as I'd like. To feel like I belong here. I'm just as scared as you. I have nothing left. And all I feel is this cruel wanting. We've been falling for all this time. And now I'm lost in paradise. Run away, run away. One day we won't feel this pain anymore. Take it all away. Shadows of you. 'Cause they won't let me go. Till I have nothing left. And all I feel is this cruel wanting. We've been falling for all this time. And now I'm lost in paradise. Alone and lost in paradise"

Sol√≠as cautivarme por tu resonante luz. Pero ahora estoy aferrada a la vida. Que has dejado atr√°s. Tu cara persigue los que alguna vez fueron. Sue√±os placenteros. Tu voz ha alejado toda mi racionalidad. Estas heridas parecen no sanar. Este dolor es demasiado real. Hay tanto que el tiempo no puede borrar. Cuando lloraste te sequ√© las l√°grimas. Cuando gritaste alej√© todos tus miedos. Y sostuve tu mano a trav√©s de estos a√±os. Pero todav√≠a lo tienes todo de m√≠. Trat√© de convencerme de que te has ido. Y aunque a√∫n sigues conmigo.

3,evanescence,My Last Breath,Hold on to me love. You know I can't stay long. All I wanted to say was I love you. And I'm not afraid. Can you hear me?. Can you feel me in your arms?. Chorus:. Holding my last breath. Safe inside myself. Are all my thoughts of you. Sweet raptured light. It ends here tonight. I'll miss the winter. A world of fragile things. Look for me in the white forest. Hiding in a hollow tree. (Come find me). I know you hear me. I can taste it in your tears. Chorus:. Holding my last breath. Safe inside myself. Are all my thoughts of you. Sweet raptured light. It ends here tonight. Closing your eyes to disappear. You pray your dreams. Will leave you here. But still you wake and know the truth. No one's there. Say goodnight. Don't be afraid. Calling me calling me. As you fade to black. Holding my last breath. Safe inside myself. Are all my thoughts of you. Sweet raptured light. It ends here tonight

3,evanescence,Never Go Back,"Everything is so dark. And I know there's something wrong but I can't turn the light on. In that split second change. When you knew we couldn't hold on. I realized I live to love you. Save yourself!. Don't look back!. Tearing us apart until it's all gone. The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves. But I remember. I won't give up on you. I can feel you in my heart just show me the way. I don't belong here. Alone. I can still see your face. Where it's burned into my mind. I die every time. I close my eyes, you're always there. Save yourself!. Don't look back!. Tearing us apart until it's all gone. The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves. But I'm the one who's drowning. Without your love. I am lost and I can never go back home. All across the ocean. We are calling. Calling.... Ah. Ah, are you there?. Nothing left for me 'till I find you because it's. All gone. The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves. But I'm the one who's drowning. Without your love. I am lost and I can never go back. I can never go back home"
3,evanescence,New Way To Bleed,"Save your twisted enemy. So you might earn forgiveness. You know your whole world is waiting. So why can't you speak?. I feel it coming over me. I'm still a slave to these dreams. Is this the end of everything?. Or just a new way to bleed?. So go and tell all your friends. That I'm a failure underneath. If it makes you feel like a bigger man. But it's my, my heart, my life that you're calling a lie. I've played this game before. And I can't take anymore. I feel it coming over me. I'm still a slave to these dreams. Is this the end of everything?. Or just a new way to bleed?. By drifting far beyond the end. Freedom, freedom can't you feel the ground caving in?. Freedom, give us a reason to believe again. I feel it coming over me. I'm still a slave to these dreams. Is this the end of everything?. Or just a new way to bleed?"

3,evanescence,Oceans,Don't want to be the one to walk away. But I can't bear the thought of one more day. I think I finally understand what it means to be lost. Can't find the road to lead us out of this. A million miles from where we burned the bridge. Can't keep pretending everything's gonna be alright. With the whole world. Falling around me. Cross the oceans in my mind. Find the strength to say goodbye. In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands. Fallen so far from where we were before. You'll never find what you've been searching for. Something to fill the void and make up for all of those missing pieces of you. Like I could only dream to do. Cross the oceans in my mind. Find the strength to say goodbye. Everything that we believed in was a lie. Cross the oceans in your mind. Find a way to blur the line. In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands. And we never learn. So we fall down again. Heaven help me find a way to dream. Within this nightmare. Cross the oceans in my mind. Find the strength to say goodbye. Everything that we believed in was a lie. Cross the oceans in your mind. Find a way to blur the line. In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands

3,evanescence,Orestes,"Metaphor for a missing moment. Pull me in to your perfect circle. One womb, One shame, One resolve. Liberate this will. To release us all. Gotta cut away, clear away,. Snip away and severe this. Umbilical residue. Keeping me from killing you. And from pulling you down with me here. I can almost hear you scream. One more medicated peaceful moment (give me). One more medicated peaceful moment. And I don't wanna feel this overwhelming hostility. No, I don't wanna feel this overwhelming hostility. Gotta cut away clear away. Snip away and sever this umbilical residue. Gotta cut away clear away. Snip away and sever this umbilical residue. Keeping me from killing you. Keeping me from killing you"

3,evanescence,People Are Strange,People are strange. When you're a stranger. Faces look ugly when you're alone. Women seem wicked. When you're unwanted. Streets are uneven. When you're down. When you're strange. Faces come out of the rain. When you're strange. One remembers your name. When you're strange
3,evanescence,Sally's Song,"I sense there's something in the wind. That feels like tragedy's at hand. And though I'd like to stand by him. Can't shake this feeling that I have. The worst is just around the bend. And does he notice my feelings for him?. And will he see how much he means to me?. I think it's not to be. What will become of my dear friend?. Where will his actions lead us then?. Although I'd like to join the crowd. In their enthusiastic cloud. Try as I may, it doesn't last. And will we ever end up together?. And will we ever end up together?. no, I think not, it's never to become. For I am not the one"
3,evanescence,Say You Will,"It's taking you too long to decide. And I don't want to be the one, the one. Crying over wasting time. If you think you're strong enough to let me in. Then come on, stand up and be honest, be honest. I'm tired of feeling so alone. Cause you won't let me understand (let me understand). I don't want to pretend. I want to feel, I want to live. Say you will or say you won't. Open your heart to me. Now or never tell the truth. Is this real, is this real?. Whenever you're around I can't fight it. You get under my skin in a way that I like it. And I can't take anymore. Tell me what you want from me. Or leave me alone. Cause I'm all caught up. And I'm losing control. I'm tired of holding on so tight. When you won't let me understand (let me understand). Now I'm falling apart. I never meant to lose myself. Say you will or say you won't. Open your heart to me. Now or never tell the truth. Is this real, is this real?. Say you will or say you won't. Open your heart to me. Now or never tell the truth. Is this real, is this real?. Like drops of rain against my heart. Cut through like silver. And I want to make you feel that way. And I want to make you feel the way that I do. Say you will or say you won't. Open your heart to me. Now or never tell the truth. Is this real?. Say you will or say you wont. open your heart to me. Now or never tell the truth. Is this real, is this real?"
3,evanescence,Secret Door,"Turn out the lights. Feed the fire till my soul breaks free. My heart is high as the waves above me. Don't need to understand. Too lost to lose. Don't fight my tears, cause they feel so good. And I, I will remember how to fly. Unlock the heavens in my mind. Follow my love back through the same secret door. Look past the end. It's a dream, as it's always been. All life lives on if we've ever loved it. And I, I will remember how to fly. Unlock the heavens in my mind. Follow my love back through the same secret door"
3,evanescence,Sick,"Embrace the silence. 'Cause there's nothing that can change the way I feel. Taken all that you wanted. Now there's nothing that can change the way I feel. Hold on, little girl. The end is soon to come. Sick of it all. Sick of it all. We will not follow. Sick of it all. Sick of it all. They don't understand how. Sick we are, sick we are. Of this bottomless pit of lies. Behind closed eyes. Oceans between us. And there's nothing that can change the way I feel. I can still taste the poison. Of every thought. Every breathe I wasted here. Hold on, little girl. The end is soon to come. Sick of it all. Sick of it all. We will not follow. Sick of it all. Sick of it all. They don't understand how. Sick we are, sick we are. Of this bottomless pit of lies. Behind closed eyes. Someday you'll know the pain. Someday the light will break through. And nothing you tell yourself will save us from the truth. Screaming out. Sick of it all. Sick of it all. We will not follow. Sick of it all. Sick of it all. They don't understand how. Sick we are, sick we are. Of this bottomless pit of lies. Behind closed eyes"
3,evanescence,Snow White Queen,"Stoplight lock the door. Don't look back. Undress in the dark. And hide from you. All of you. You'll never know the way your words have haunted me. I can't believe you'd ask these things of me. You don't know me, now and ever. You belong to me. My Snow White Queen. There's nowhere to run, so lets just get it over. Soon I know you'll see. You're just like me. Don't scream anymore my love, cause all I want is you. Wake up in a dream. Frozen fear. All your hands on me. I can't scream. I can't escape the twisted way you think of me. I feel you in my dreams and I don't sleep. I don't sleep. You belong to me. My Snow White Queen. There's nowhere to run, so lets just get it over. Soon I know you'll see. You're just like me. Don't scream anymore my love, cause all I want is you. I can't save your life. Though nothing I bleed for is more tormenting. I'm losing my mind. And you just stand there and stare as my world divides. You belong to me. My Snow White Queen. There's nowhere to run, so lets just get it over. Soon I know you'll see. You're just like me. Don't scream anymore my love, cause all I want is you. All I want is you. All I want is you. All I want is you"
3,evanescence,So Close,"I've spent so much time. Throwing rocks at your window. That I never even knocked. On the front door. I walk by statues. Never even made one chip. But if I could leave a mark. On the monument of the heart. I just might lay myself down for a little more than I had. The last day, the last day, the last day. Wait a time. To spare these lies we tell ourselves. These days have come and gone. But this time is sweeter than honey"
3,evanescence,Solitude,"How many times have you told me you love her. As many times as I've wanted to tell you the truth. How long have I stood here beside you. I live through you. You looked through me. Ooh, Solitude,. Still with me is only you. Ooh, Solitude,. I can't stay away from you. How many times have I done this to myself. How long will it take before I see. When will this hole in my heart be mended. Who now is left alone but me. Ooh, Solitude,. Forever me and forever you. Ooh, Solitude,. Only you, only true. Everyone leave me stranded. Forgotten, abandoned, left behind. I can't stay here another night. Your secret admirer. Who could it be. Ooh, Can't you see. All along it was me. How can you be so blind. As to see right through me. And Ooh, Solitude,. Still with me is only you. Ooh, Solitude,. I can't stay away from you. Ooh, Solitude,. Forever me and forever you. Ooh, Solitude,. Only you, only true"
3,evanescence,Surrender,"Is this real enough for you?. You were so confused. Now that you?ve decided to stay. We?ll remain together. (Chorus). You can?t abandon me, you belong to me. Breathe in and take my life in you. No longer myself, only you. There?s no escaping me my love. Surrender. Darling there?s no sense in running. You know I will find you. Everything is perfect now, we can live forever. (Chorus). Hands up slowly, give in to. Breathe in and take my life in you. No longer myself only you. There?s no escaping me my love. Surrender [4X]. You must surrender to me. There?s no escaping, for me. I know you¬¥re holding to me. You must surrender to me"
3,evanescence,Sweet Sacrifice,"It's true, we're all a little insane. But its so clear, now that I'm unchained. Fear is only in our minds. Taking over all the time. Fear is only in our minds. But it's taking over all the time. You poor sweet innocent thing. Dry your eyes and testify. You know you live to break me. Don't deny, sweet sacrifice. One day I'm gonna forget your name. And one sweet day,. you're gonna drown in my lost pain. Fear is only in our minds. Taking over all the time. Fear is only in our minds. But it's taking over all the time. You poor sweet innocent thing. Dry your eyes and testify. And oh you love to hate me. Don't you, honey? I'm your sacrifice. [I dream in darkness. I sleep to die. Erase the silence. Erase my life. Our burning ashes. Blacken the day. A world of nothingness. Blow me away]. Do you wonder why you hate?. Are you still too weak. to survive your mistakes?. You poor sweet innocent thing. Dry your eyes and testify. You know you live to break me. Don't deny, sweet sacrifice"
3,evanescence,Swimming Home,"Way down. I've been way down. Underneath this skin. Waiting to hear my name again. I'm sorry, nothing can hold me. I adore you still. But I hear them calling. And nothing can hold me. Way down. All the way down. I will hear your voice. But I'll no longer understand. I'm sorry, nothing can hold me. I adore you still. But I hear them calling. I was looking to the sky. When I knew. I'd been swimming home. I cannot betray my kind. They are here. It's my time. I'm sorry, nothing can hold me. I adore you still. But I hear them calling (calling). And nothing can hold me"
3,evanescence,Take Cover,"By the way that you talk to me. I can see the lie you're dreaming I'll believe. By the way, don't you forget who you are now. cause that's not your name. You'd better take cover. (Cause I'm on my way now). I'm coming back to take your world down. Move over, if you can. Or you're gonna wish that you did. Slave to your insecurity. That's what drove you down in the first place. but you haven't learned a thing. Caught in your thick web of lies. Gonna be the bitch you make me out to be. Oh you'd better take cover. (Nothing you can say now). You underestimated my wrath. Move over, if you can. I'm gonna give the love back. Take cover. (Cause I'm on my way now). I'm gonna have to take you all down. Move over, if you can. Or you're gonna wish that you did"
3,evanescence,Taking Over Me,You don't remember me but I remember you. I lie awake and try so hard not to think of you. But who can decide what they dream?. And dream I do.... I believe in you. I'll give up everything just to find you. I have to be with you to live to breathe. You're taking over me. Have you forgotten all I know. And all we had?. You saw me mourning my love for you. And touched my hand. I knew you loved me then. I believe in you. I'll give up everything just to find you. I have to be with you to live to breathe. you're taking over me. I look in the mirror and see your face. If i look deep enough. So many things inside that are just like you are taking over. believe in you. I'll give up everything just to find you. I have to be with you to live to breathe. You're taking over me
3,evanescence,Taking Over Me (traducci√≥n),"tu no me recuerdas pero yo si te recuerdo. estoy acostada despierta y tratando de no pensar en ti. ¬øpero quien puede decidir que so√±ar?. y yo sue√±o.... yo creo en ti. renunciare solo para encontrarte. tengo que estar contigo para vivir, para respirar. tu tienes el poder sobre mi. ¬øhas olvidado todolo que se. y todo lo que teniamos?. me viste llorar por la muerte de mi amor por ti. y tocaste mi mano. supe que me amabas en ese entonces. yo creo en ti.... miro el espejo y veo tu cara. si miro con suficinte profundidad. tienas el poder. sobre tantas cosas en mi interior"
3,evanescence,The Change,"Thought that I was strong. I know the words I need to say. Frozen in my place. I let the moment slip away. I've been screaming. On the inside. And I know you feel the pain. Can you hear me?. Can you hear me?. Say it's over. Yes, it's over. But I need you anyway. Say you love me, but it's not enough. Never meant to lie. But I'm not the girl you think you know. The more that I am with you. The more that I am all alone. I've been screaming. On the inside. And I know you feel the pain. Can you hear me?. Can you hear me?. Say it's over. Yes, it's over. But I need you anyway. Say you love me, but it's not enough. Not that I'm so different. Not that I don't see. The dying light of what we used to be. How can I forgive you?. You changed!. And I'm a liar by your side. I'm about to lose my mind. 'Cause I've been screaming. On the inside. And I know you feel the pain. Can you hear me?. Can you hear me?. You've been dreaming. If you're thinking. That I still belong to you. And I've been dying. 'Cause I'm lying to myself!. Say it's over. Yes, it's over. But I need you anyway. Say you love me, but it's not enough"
3,evanescence,The End,instrumental
3,evanescence,The End Of The Dream,"I found a grave. Brushed off the face. Felt your light. And I remember why I know this place. I found a bird. Closing her eyes one last time. And I wonder if she dreamed like me. As much as it hurts, ain't it wonderful to feel?. So go on and break your wings. Follow your heart till it bleeds. As we run towards the end of the dream. I'm not afraid. I push through the pain. And I'm on fire. I remember how to breathe again. As much as it hurts, ain't it wonderful to feel?. So go on and break your wings. Follow your heart till it bleeds. As we run towards the end of the dream. Why must we fall apart. To understand how to fly. I will find a way. Even without wings. Follow your heart till it bleeds. As we run towards the end of the dream. Follow your heart till it bleeds. And we've gone to the end of the dream"
3,evanescence,The Last Song I'm Wasting On You,"Sparkling Gray,. They're my own veins. Any more than a whisper. Any sudden movement of my heart. And I know, I know I'll have to watch them pass away. Just get through this day. Give up your way, you could be anything,. Give up my way, and lose myself, not today. That's too much guilt to pay. Sickened in the sun. You dare tell me you love me. But you held me down and screamed you wanted me to die. Honey you know, you know I'd never hurt you that way.. You're just so pretty in your pain.. Give up my way, and I could be anything. I'll make my own way. Without your senseless hate.... So run, run, run. And hate me, if it feels good. I can't hear your screams anymore. You lied to me. But I'm older now. And I'm not buying baby. Demanding my response. Don't bother breaking the door down. I found my way out. And you'll never hurt me again."
3,evanescence,The Only One,"You know you're not the only one. When they all come crashing down (midflight). You know you're not the only one. When they're so alone they find. A back door out of life. You know you're not the only one. We're all grieving. Lost and bleeding. All our lives. We've been waiting. For someone to call our leader. All your lies. I'm not believing. Heaven shine a light down on me. So afraid to open your eyes (hypnotized). You know you're not the only one. Never understood this life. And you're right I don't deserve. But you know I'm not the only one. We're all grieving. Lost and bleeding. All our lives. We've been waiting. For someone to call our leader. All your lies. I'm not believing. Heaven shine a light down on me. Don't look down. Don't look into the eyes of the world beneath you. Don't look down. You'll fall down. You'll become their sacrifice. Right or wrong. Can't hold on to the fear. That I'm lost without you. If I can't feel, I'm not mine,. I'm not real. All our lives. We've been waiting. For someone to call our leader. All your lies. I'm not believing. Heaven shine a light down on me"
3,evanescence,The Other Side,Make me whole again. Open your eyes. Taunted by the shadows of your light. Cold and far away. Like you're not even mine. Undo everything and take me. Higher. Never believing what they say cause I'm.... Counting the days to meet you on the other side. I will always be waiting. Until the day that I see you on the other side. Come and take me home. I'm not giving you. I want you back. Holding together by the shards of our past. Stole my heart away. I can't let you go. Break these chains and let me fly to you. High above the world below. Over and over in my mind. Counting the days to meet you on the other side. I will always be waiting. Until the day that I see you on the other side. Come and take me.... Home. I am so lost without my place inside your heart. I won't survive I need to know you hear me. Awake and release my love. Counting the days to meet you on the other side. I will always be waiting. Until the day that I see you on the other side. Come and take me. Counting the days to meet you on the other side. I will always be waiting. Until the day that I see you on the other side. Come and take me home
3,evanescence,Thoughtless,"All of my hate cannot be found. I will not be drowned. By your thoughtless scheming. Though you can try to tear me down. Beat me to the ground. I will see you screaming. Thumbing through the pages of my fantasies. Pushing all the mercy down, down, down. Wanna see you try to take a swing at me. Come on, gonna put you on the ground, ground, ground. Why are you trying to make fun of me?. You think it's funny?. What the fuck you think you're doing to me?. You take you turn lashing out me. I want you crying with you. Dirty ass in front of me.

3,evanescence,Together Again,Never tought that I'd be leaving you today. So alone and wondering why I feel this way. So wide the world. Can love remember how to get me home to you someday?. We'll be together again. All just a dream in the end. We'll be together again. So many fears were swimming around and around in my mind. Who would have dreamed the secrets we would find?. I've found a world where love and dreams and darkness all colide. Maybe this time we can leave our broken world behind. We'll be together again. All just I dream in the end
3,evanescence,Tourniquet,I tried to kill the pain. But only brought more (so much more). I lay dying. And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal. I'm dying praying bleeding and screaming. Am I too lost to be saved?. Am I too lost?. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. Do you remember me. Lost for so long. Will you be on the other side. Or will you forget me. I'm dying praying bleeding and screaming. Am I too lost to be saved. Am I too lost?. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. I want to die. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. My wounds cry for the grave. My soul cries for deliverance. Will I be denied christ. Tourniquet. My suicide
3,evanescence,Understanding,"You hold the answer deep within your own mind.. Consciously, you've forgotten it.. That's the way the human mind works.. Whenever something is too unpleasant. Too shameful for us to entertain,. We reject it.. We erase it from our memory,. But the imprint is always there.. [We wash it all away]. [We wish it all away]. [We hope it all away].

Please don't be afraid. When the darkness fades away. The dawn will break the silence, screaming at our hearts. My love for you still grows. This I do for you. Before I try to fight the truth my final time. We're supposed to try to be real.. We feel alone when we're not together. And that is real.. [We wash it all away]. [We wish it all away]. [We hope it all away]. [Can't cry it all away]. Lying beside you, listening to you breathe. The light that flows inside of you, burns inside of me. Hold and speak to me. Of love without a sound.

Say you'll be with me. For I know I cannot. Bear it all alone. Can't fight it all away. Can't hope it all away. Can't scream it all away. It just won't fade away. I've tried so hard. (Tried to be without you for so many years). No No No. And I Have cried. (So many words i have saved for someone, for sometime)"

I been livin like a star 'cause it's gettin' me high,. Forget the hearse, 'cause I never die. I got nine lives, cat's eyes. abusing every one of them and running wild. [Chorus]. 'Cause I'm back! Yes, I'm back!. Well, I'm back! Yes, I'm back!. Well, I'm baaack, baaack.... Well, I'm back in black,. Yes, I'm back in black!. Back in a band,I got Cadillac,. Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack. Yes I'm in a band with a gang,. they gotta catch me if they want me to hang. 'Cause I'm back on the track. and I'm beatin' the flack,. Nobody's gonna get me on another trap. So look at me now, I'm just a makin' my pay,. Don't try to push your luck,. just get outta my way. [Chorus]. 'Cause I'm back! Yes, I'm back!. Well, I'm back! Yeah, I'm back!. Well, I'm baaack, baaack.... Well, I'm back in black,. Yes, I'm back in black!. Let's go!. [Chorus]. Well, I'm back! Yes, I'm back!. Well, I'm back! Yes, I'm back!. Well, I'm baaack, baaack.... Well, I'm back in black,. Yes, I'm back in black-ow!. Aww yeah! Let's go!. Keep on goin'! Yeah yeah!. Yeah... aww yeah yeah!. Here we go!. [Chorus]. Well, I'm baaack...

Cold hearted man, cold hearted man. Like a snake he had no friends. He didn't need no one. Hurt his pride, deep inside. He was another mothers son. Reputation, broken glass. Everybody prayed. For their lives on the street where they happened to meet. Leeroy Kincaid. Cold hearted man, one time lover heart in his hand. Cold hearted man, and you can't trust nothing you don't understand. Cold hearted man, cold hearted man. Sometimes you can't see the other side. It's too well hidden for the naked eye. One time lover with his heart in his hand. Two time loser, a broken man.

And I fell in love with the dirty little bitch. She's got the jack, she's got the jack. She's got the jack, she's got the jack. She's got the jack, she's got the jack. She's got the jack, she's got the jack. She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack. She's got the jack. I searched her mind. And then I searched her body. ...But so did everybody. But she gave me her heart. And she gave me her soul. And a great, big - warn out. Empty hole. But how was I to know it had been filled in before. She said, Bon, I've never had the urgency. She was number nine, ninety-nine on the critical list. And I fell in love with the dirty little bitch. She's got the Jack. (I'll kill her). (Oh and it hurts). You know, I woke up one morning. and there it was on the sheets -the clap. Now I know you all call it the clap. Over here so what I'm gonnado. I'm gonna say She's got the --. and I want you all to shoutout. Just what it is she's got, in this case it's the clap. And if you wanna know who gave it to her. don't look at me"
4,ac-dc,The Price You Pay,"There's a small jail in georgia you all know,. Where the sun's so hot and the daylight don't show.. Where the moccasin she rests on a soft bed of sand,. You can hear the hound dog howling out the land.. Chorus:. It ain't the way i wanted it.. But lord that's the price you pay.. I said jailer bring me water for my throat is dry,. Four walls, steel bars, i've been watching passersby,. I've been sitting here so long i'm starting to cry,. The hangman's coming, i'm surely going to die.. Chorus:. It ain't the way i wanted it.. But lord that's the price you pay.. Oh, honk on it, boy,. A little jail cell blues here.. Lead break. I shot a man in macon over a poker game,. I killed another in atlanta just to build my fame,. Well, now i hear the hammers they're pounding out my name.. It ain't the way i wanted it.. But that's the price you pay.. It ain't the way i wanted it.. But lord that's the price you pay.. Hey jailer, how about that water my throat's still dry,. Four walls, steel bars, i've been watching passersby,. I've been sitting here so damn long i'm starting to cry,. The hangman's coming i'm surely going to die.. It ain't the way i wanted it.. But lord that's the price you pay,. (repeat),. It ain't the way i wanted it,. But lord that's the price you pay.. Oh, you done out of rope son."

Ain't no joke, ain't no place for kids. When the flags are high, hear the battle cry. Treaty gone, see the bandits fly. Dig the trench, watch that blast. Shell shock come, coming fast. Name and rank on parade. Might get laid by a hand grenade. Do you know what it means?. This - means - war. This means war, this means war. I said this means war, this means war. This means war. (run for cover, hit the deck, call for your mother). I need you to fire. Cock your gun, wet your sights. Get the bull dead to rights. Volunteers, one pace back. On the beach ain't no place for kids. When the flack is high on a bomber run. You don't talk back to an ack-ack gun. Fire range, and you're in the blitz. Keep your head or you're blown to bits. Name and rank on parade. Might get laid by a hand grenade. Do you know what it means?. This - means - war. Who's going there, is it a friend or foe?. Propaganda time on the radio. Top brass shout as they clown around. Peace talks die in geneva town. Do you know what it means?. This - means - war. This means war, this means war. I said this means war, this means war. This means war"

4,ac-dc,Touch Too Much,"It was one of those nights when you turn out the lights. And everything comes into view. She was taking her time, I was loosing my mind. There was nothing that she wouldn't do. It wasn't the first, wasn't the last. She knew we were making love. I was so satisfied deep down inside. Like a hand in a velvet glove. Seems like a touch, a touch too much. Seems like a touch, a touch too much. Too much for my body, too much for my brain. This damn woman's gonna drive me insane. She has a touch, a touch too much. She had the face of an angel, smiling with sin. The body of venus with arms. Dealin' with danger, strokin' my skin. Like a thunder and lightening storm. It wasn't the first, wasn't the last. It wasn't that she didn't care. She wanted it hard, wanted it fast. She liked it done medium rare. Seems like a touch, a touch too much. Seems like a touch, a touch too much. Too much for my body, too much for my brain. This damn woman's gonna drive me insane. She has a touch, a touch too much. Touch me!. Seems like a touch (touch too much). You know it's much too much (much too much). I really wanna feel ya (touch too much). Girl, you know you're givin' me (much too much). Seems like a touch (touch too much).

4,ac-dc,Two's Up,"Three is company. Come on,. Last stand. Down to my last dime. I ain't got the sense to leave. The dealers cutting fine. Last draw. Back against the wall. Depending where the money is. Is where I'm gonna fall. Ace high. Hide your poker eyes. I didn't want to laugh too much. When I picked up the prize. Lady Luck. Standing at my side. I'll leave with more than I brought in. And I get out with my life. I get out with my life. CHORUS:. I go, you go, she go, we go. Two's up, it's a two's up. Give me head, give me tails. Give me doubled up and coming doubled over on the rails. Give me two's up, it's what I want. (Alright). High up. When you're looking down. Then you see two animals. Just fooling you around. Stray dogs. Gonna take them in. I don't know what your names are. But you're gonna break them in. All day. It's difficult to say. Who is doing what to whom. Who's out of the play. I love. The way you slide and slip. Love the way you girls work out. And make the partnership. Make that partnership. CHORUS. (Gotta give me double or quits). Two's up, two's up. Like your partnership. Like the way you slip. There ain't nothing like a two's up. That's the way it is, two's up. It's what I want to hear. Give me head, give me tails. Give me doubled up and coming over on the rails. Two's up, it's locomotion. Two's up, you're drivin' me wild. Give me high, give me low. Give me twice the satisfaction. Twice the pot of gold (?). And it's a two's up. It's gonna be two's up. We're gonna have a two's up, two's up, two's up, two's up. There ain't nothin' like a two's up. [Marcos A. Tancon]"

It's her love got to have. It's her love. But what's next to the moon?. Long Arm looking for a fingerprint. Trying to find the mystery clue. Hitting me with the third degree. Working on a thumb screw. Alright, officer, I confess. Everything's coming back. I didn't mean to hurt that woman of mine. It was a heart attack. (CHORUS:). It's her love that I want. It's her love that I need. It's her love got to have. It's her love. What's next to the moon. If not the sky, oh baby, say bye-bye."

Knockin' me out with those American thighs. Taking more than her share. Had me fighting for air. She told me to come, but I was already there. Cause the walls started shaking. The earth was quaking. My mind was aching. And we were makin' it. and you.... Shook me all night long. Yeah you, shook me all night long. Walking double time on the seduction line. She was one of a kind. She's just mine all mine. Wanted no applause. It's just another cause. Made a meal out of me, and come back for more. Had to cool me down. To take another round. Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing. But the walls was shaking. Earth was quaking. My mind was aching. And we were making it. and you.... Shook me all night long. Yeah you, shook me all night long. Knockin' me out, yeah you. Shook me all night long. You really shook me, yeah you. Shook me all night long. Yeah, you shook me. Well you shook me....
