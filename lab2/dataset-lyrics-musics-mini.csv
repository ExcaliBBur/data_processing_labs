0,david-bowie,Heroes,"I, I will be king. And you, you will be queen. Though nothing will drive them away. We can beat them, just for one day. We can be Heroes, just for one day. And you, you can be mean. And I, I'll drink all the time. 'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact. Yes we're lovers, and that is that. Though nothing, will keep us together. We could steal time,. just for one day. We can be Heroes, for ever and ever. What d'you say?. I, I wish you could swim. Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim. Though nothing, nothing will keep us together. We can beat them, for ever and ever. Oh we can be Heroes, just for one day. I, I will be king. And you, you will be queen. Though nothing will drive us away. We can be Heroes, just for one day. We can be us, just for one day. I, I can remember (I remember). Standing, by the wall (by the wall). And the guns, shot above our heads. (over our heads). And we kissed, as though nothing could fall. (nothing could fall). And the shame, was on the other side. Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever. Then we could be Heroes, just for one day. We can be Heroes. We can be Heroes. We can be Heroes. Just for one day. We can be Heroes. We're nothing, and nothing will help us. Maybe we're lying,. then you better not stay. But we could be safer, just for one day. Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh, just for one day"
0,david-bowie,Starman,"Didn't know what time it was,. The lights were low. I leaned back on my radio. Some cat was layin' down. Some rock 'n' roll 'lotta soul, he said. Then the loud sound did seem to fade. Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase. That weren't no D.J. that was hazy cosmic jive. There's a starman waiting in the sky. He'd like to come and meet us. But he thinks he'd blow our minds. There's a starman waiting in the sky. He's told us not to blow it. Cause he knows it's all worthwhile. He told me:. Let the children lose it. Let the children use it. Let all the children boogie. I had to phone someone so I picked on you. Hey, that's far out so you heard him too!. Switch on the Tv we may pick him up on channel two. Look out your window I can see his light. If we can sparkle he may land tonight. Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up. In fright. There's a starman waiting in the sky. He'd like to come and meet us. But he thinks he'd blow our minds. There's a starman waiting in the sky. He's told us not to blow it. Cause he knows it's all worthwhile. He told me:. Let the children lose it. Let the children use it. Let all the children boogie. There's a starman waiting in the sky. He'd like to come and meet us. But he thinks he'd blow our minds. There's a starman waiting in the sky. He's told us not to blow it. Cause he knows it's all worthwhile. He told me:. Let the children lose it. Let the children use it. Let all the children boogie"
0,david-bowie,Space Oddity,"Ground control to Major Tom. Ground control to Major Tom. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on. Ground control to Major Tom. (10, 9, 8, 7). Commencing countdown, engines on. (6, 5, 4, 3). Check ignition, and may God's love be with you. (2, 1, liftoff). This is ground control to Major Tom,. You've really made the grade. And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear. Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare. This is Major Tom to ground control. I'm stepping through the door. And I'm floating in the most peculiar way. And the stars look very different today. For here am I sitting in a tin can. Far above the world. Planet Earth is blue, and there's nothing I can do. Though I'm past 100,000 miles. I'm feeling very still. And I think my spaceship knows which way to go. Tell my wife I love her very much, she knows. Ground control to Major Tom,. Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong. Can you hear me Major Tom?. Can you hear me Major Tom?. Can you hear me Major Tom?. Can you.... Here am I floating round my tin can. Far above the moon. Planet Earth is blue, and there's nothing I can do...."
0,david-bowie,Life On Mars?,"It's a god-awful small affair. To the girl with the mousy hair. But her mummy is yelling No. And her daddy has told her to go. But her friend is nowhere to be seen. Now she walks through her sunken dream. To the seat with the clearest view. And she's hooked to the silver screen. But the film is a saddening bore. For she's lived it ten times or more. She could spit in the eyes of fools. As they ask her to focus on. Sailors fighting in the dance hall. Oh man! Look at those cavemen go. It's the freakiest show. Take a look at the Lawman. Beating up the wrong guy. Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know. He's in the best selling show. Is there life on Mars?. It's on Amerika's tortured brow. That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow. Now the workers have struck for fame. 'Cause Lennon's on sale again. See the mice in their million hordes. From Ibeza to the Norfolk Broads. Rule Britannia is out of bounds. To my mother, my dog, and clowns. But the film is a saddening bore. 'Cause I wrote it ten times or more. It's about to be writ again. As I ask you to focus on. Sailors fighting in the dance hall. Oh man! Look at those cavemen go. It's the freakiest show. Take a look at the Lawman. Beating up the wrong guy. Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know. He's in the best selling show. Is there life on Mars?"
0,david-bowie,Modern Love,"I know when to go out. And when to stay in. Get things done. I catch a paper boy. But things don't really change. I'm standing in the wind. But I never wave bye-bye. But I try, I try. There's no sign of life. It's just the power to charm. I'm lying in the rain. But I never wave bye-bye. But I try, I try. Never gonna fall for. Modern love walks beside me. Modern love walks on by. Modern love gets me to the church on time. Church on time terrifies me. Church on time makes me party. Church on time puts my trust in god and man. God and man no confessions. God and man no religion. God and man don't believe in modern love. It's not really work. It's just the power to charm. I'm still standing in the wind. But I never wave bye bye. But I try, I try. Never gonna fall for. Modern love walks beside me. Modern love walks on by. Modern love gets me to the church on time. Church on time terrifies me. Church on time makes me party. Church on time puts my trust in god and man. God and man no confessions. God and man no religion. God and man don't believe in modern love. Modern love - Modern love. Modern love - Modern love, walks beside me. Modern love - Modern love, walks on by"
0,david-bowie,Changes,"I still don't know what I was waiting for. And my time was running wild. A million dead-end streets. Every time I thought I'd got it made. It seemed the taste was not so sweet. So I turned myself to face me. But I've never caught a glimpse. Of how the others must see the faker. I'm much too fast to take that test. Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes. (Turn and face the strange). Ch-ch-Changes. Don't want to be a richer man. Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes. (Turn and face the strange). Ch-ch-Changes. Just gonna have to be a different man. Time may change me. But I can't trace time. I watch the ripples change their size. But never leave the stream. Of warm impermanence and. So the days float through my eyes. But still the days seem the same. And these children that you spit on. As they try to change their worlds. Are immune to your consultations. They're quite aware of what they're going through. Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes. (Turn and face the strange). Ch-ch-Changes. Don't tell them to grow up and out of it. Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes. (Turn and face the strange). Ch-ch-Changes. Where's your shame. You've left us up to our necks in it. Time may change me. But you can't trace time. Strange fascination, fascinating me. Changes are taking the pace I'm going through. Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes. (Turn and face the strange). Ch-ch-Changes. Oh, look out you rock 'n rollers. Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes. (Turn and face the strange). Ch-ch-Changes. Pretty soon now you're gonna get older. Time may change me. But I can't trace time. I said that time may change me. But I can't trace time"
0,david-bowie,Let's Dance,"Let's dance. Put on your red shoes and dance the blues. Let's dance. To the song they're playin' on the radio. Let's sway. While colour lights up your face. Let's sway. Sway through the crowd to an empty space. Chorus:. If you say run, I'll run with you. If you say hide, we'll hide. Because my love for you. Would break my heart in two. If you should fall. Into my arms. And tremble like a flower. Let's dance. For fear your grace should fall. Let's dance. For fear tonight is all. Let's sway. You could look into my eyes. Let's sway. Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight. Chorus. Let's dance. Put on your red shoes and dance the blues. Let's dance. To the song they're playin' on the radio. Let's sway. You could look into my eyes. Let's sway. Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight"
0,david-bowie,The Man Who Sold The World,"We passed upon the stair,. we spoke of was and when. Although I wasn't there,. he said I was his friend. Which came as some a surprise. I spoke into his eyes. I thought you died alone,. a long long time ago. (refrão). Oh no, not me. We never lost control. You're face to face. With The Man Who Sold The World. I laughed and shook his hand,. and made my way back home. I searched for form and land,. for years and years I roamed. I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions hills. We must have died alone,. a long long time ago. Who knows? not me. I never lost control. You're face to face. With the Man who Sold the World"
0,david-bowie,As The World Falls Down,"There's such a sad love. Deep in your eyes.. A kind of pale jewel. Open and closed. Within your eyes.. I'll place the sky. Within your eyes.. There's such a fooled heart. Beatin' so fast. In search of new dreams.. A love that will last. Within your heart.. I'll place the moon. Within your heart.. As the pain sweeps through,. Makes no sense for you.. Every thrill is gone.. Wasn't too much fun at all,. But I'll be there for you-ou-ou. As the world falls down.. Falling.. As the world falls down.. Falling.. Falling in love.. I'll paint you mornings of gold.. I'll spin you Valentine evenings.. Though we're strangers 'til now,. We're choosing the path. Between the stars.. I'll leave my love. Between the stars.. As the pain sweeps through,. Makes no sense for you.. Every thrill is gone.. Wasn't too much fun at all,. But I'll be there for you-ou-ou. As the world falls down.. Falling. As the world falls down.. Falling. Falling. As the world falls down.. Falling.. Falling.. Falling. Falling in love. As the world falls down.. Falling.. Falling.. Falling.. Falling in love. As the world falls down.. Makes no sense at all.. Makes no sense to fall.. Falling. As the world falls down.. Falling.. Falling.. Falling in love. As the world falls down.. Falling.. Falling. Falling in love. Falling in love. Falling in love. Falling in love. Falling in love"
0,david-bowie,Ziggy Stardust,Ziggy played guitar. jamming good with Weird and Gilly. And the spiders from Mars. He played it left hand. But made it too far. Became the special man. then we were Ziggy's band. Ziggy really sang. screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo. Like some cat from Japan. he could lick 'em by smiling. He could leave 'em to hang. Came on so loaded man. well hung and snow white tan. So where were the spiders while. the fly tried to break our balls. Just the beer light to guide us. So we bitched about his fans and. should we crush his sweet hands?. Ziggy played for time. Jiving us that we were voodoo. The kids were just crass. he was the nazz. With God given ass. He took it all too far but. boy could he play guitar. Making love with his ego. Ziggy sucked up into his mind. Like a leper messiah. When the kids had killed the man. I had to break up the band. Ziggy played gui... tar
0,david-bowie,Moonage Daydream,"I'm an alligator, I'm a mama-papa coming for you. I'm the space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you. Keep your mouth shut, you're squawking like a big monkey bird. And I'm busting up my brains for the words. Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe. Put your ray gun to my head.

Under pressure, that burns a building down. Splits a family in two. Puts people on streets. Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah. Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah. That's o-kay. It's the terror of knowing. What this world is about. Watching some good friends. Screaming `Let me out'. Pray tomorrow takes me higher. Pressure on people, people on streets. Doh doh doh bah bah bah bah. O-kay. Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor. These are the days it never rains but it pours. People on streets, people on streets. It's the terror of knowing. What this world is about,. Watching some good friends. Screaming `Let me out'. Pray tomorrow takes me higher. Pressure on people, people on streets. Turned away from it all, like a blind man. Sat on a fence but it don't work. Keep coming up with love. But it's so slashed and torn. Why why why?. Love love love love. Insanity laughs, under pressure we're cracking. Can't we give ourselves one more chance. Why can't we give love one more chance. Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love, give love. Cause love's such an old fashioned word. And love dares you to care. For the people on the edge of the night. And love dares you to change our way of. Caring about ourselves. This is our last dance. This is ourselves. Under pressure. Under pressure. Pressure"
0,david-bowie,Where Are We Now?,"Had to get the train. From Potsdamer Platz. You never knew that. That I could do that. Just walking the dead. Sitting in the Dschungel. On Nurnberger Strasse.

0,david-bowie,Ashes To Ashes,"Do you remember a guy that's been. In such an early song. I heard a rumour from Ground Control. Oh no, don't say it's true. They got a message from the action man. I'm happy, hope you're happy too. I've loved all I needed to love. Sordid details following. The shreiking of nothing is killing. Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I. ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair. But I'm hoping to kick.... but the planet is growing. Ashes to Ashes, funk to funky. We know Major Tom's a junkie. Strung out on heaven's high. Hitting an all-time low. Time and again I tell myself. I'll stay clean tonight. But the little green wheels are following me. Oh no, not again. I'm stuck with a valuable friend. I'm happy, hope you're happy too. One flash of light...but no smoking pistol. I've never done good things. I've never done bad things. I've never done anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh. Want an axe to break the ice. Want to come down right now. Ashes to Ashes, funk to funky. We know Major Tom's a junkie. Strung out on heaven's high. Hitting an all-time low. My mother said to get things done. You better not mess with Major Tom"

I'm a mess without my little China Girl. Wake up in the morning, where's my little China Girl. I hear her heart's beating loud as thunder. Saw these stars crashing down. I feel a-tragic like I'm Marlon Brando. When I look at my China Girl. I could pretend that nothing really meant too much. When I look at my China Girl. I stumble into town just like a sacred cow. Visions of swastikas in my head. Plans for everyone. It's in the white of my eyes. My little China Girl. You shouldn't mess with me. I'll ruin everything you are. You know;. I'll give you television. I'll give you eyes of blue. I'll give you men who want to rule the world. And when I get excited. My little China Girl says. Oh baby just you shut your mouth. She says ... sh-sh-shhh"
0,david-bowie,Young Americans,"They pulled in just behind the bridge. He lays her down, he frowns. gee my life's a funny thing. Am I still too young? . He kissed her then and there. She took his ring, took his babies. It took him minutes, took her nowhere. Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but. All night. She wants the young american. Young american, young american. She wants the young american. All right. She wants the young american. Scanning life through the picture windows. She finds the slinky vagabond. He coughs as he passes her ford mustang, but. Heaven forbid, she'll take anything. But the freak, and his type, all for nothing. He misses a step and cuts his hand, but. Showing nothing, he swoops like a song. She cries ; where have all papa's heroes gone? . All night. She wants the young american. Young american, young american. She wants the young american. All right. She wants the young american. All the way from washington. Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor. we live for just these twenty years. Do we have to die for the fifty more? . All night. He wants the young american. Young american, young american. He wants the young american. All right. He wants the young american. Do you remember, your president nixon?. Do you remember, the bills you have to pay. Or even yesterday?. Have you been an un-american?. Just you and your idol singing falsetto 'bout. Leather, leather everywhere, and. Not a myth left from the ghetto. Well, well, well, would you carry a razor. In case, just in case of depression. Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors. Blushing at all the afro-sheeners. Ain't that close to love?. Well, ain't that poster love?. Well, it ain't that barbie doll. Her heart's been broken just like you have. And. All night. You want the young american. Young american, young american.

Throw it down by my side. And he wants so to belch. But he's too full to try. So he stands up and laughs. And he zips up his fly. In the port of Amsterdam. You can see sailors dance. Paunches bursting their pants. Grinding women to porch. They've forgotten the tune. That their whiskey voice croaked. Splitting the night. With the roar of their jokes. And they turn and they dance. And they laugh and they lust. Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts. And then out of the night. With their pride in their pants. And the sluts that they tow. Underneath the street lamps. In the port of Amsterdam. There's a sailor who drinks. And he drinks and he drinks. And he drinks once again. He'll drink to the health. Of the whores of Amsterdam. Who've given their bodies. To a thousand other men. Yeah, they've bargained their virtue. Their goodness all gone. For a few dirty coins. Well he just can't go on. Throws his nose to the sky. And he aims it up above.

0,david-bowie,Baal's Hymn,"Whilst his mother's womb contained the growing Baal. Even then the sky was waiting quiet and pale. Naked, young, immensely marvellous. Like Baal loved it, when he came to us. That same sky remained with him in joy and care. Even when Baal slept peaceful and unaware. At night a lilac sky, a drunken Baal. Turning pious as the sky grows pale. So through hospital, cathedral, whiskey bar. Baal kept moving onwards and just let things go. When Baal's tired, boys, Baal cannot fall far. He will have his sky down there below. When the sinners congregate in shame together. Baal lay naked, revelling in their distress. Only sky, a sky that will go on forever. Formed a blanket for his nakedness. And that lusty girl, the world, who'll laughing yield. To the men who'll stand the pressure of her thighs. Sometimes gave him love-bites, such as can't be healed. Baal survived it, he just used his eyes. And when Baal saw lots of corpses scattered round. He felt twice the thrill, despite the lack of room. Space enough said Baal, then I'll thicken the ground. Space enough within this woman's womb. Any vice for Baal has got its useful side. It's the man who practices it, he can't abide. Vices have their point, once you see it as such. Stick to two for one will be too much. Slackness, softness are the sort of things to shun. Nothing could be harder than the quest for fun. Lots of strength is needed and experience too. Swollen bellies can embarrass you. Under gloomy stars and this poor veil of tears. Baal will graze a pasture till it disappears. Once it's been digested to the forest's teeth. Baal trod singing for a well earned sleep. Baal can spot the vultures in the stormy sky. As they wait up there to see if Baal will die. Sometimes Baal pretends he's dead, but vultures swoop. Baal in silence dines on vulture-soup. When the dark womb drags him down to its prize. What's the world still mean to Baal, he's overfed. So much sky is lurking still behind his eyes. He'll just have enough sky when he's dead. Once the Earth's dark womb engulfed the rotting Baal. Even then the sky was up there, quiet and pale. Naked, young, immensely marvellous."

Gone the roof overhead, but the sky was always there. Oh you, who are flung out, alike from heaven and from Hades. You murderers who've been so bitterly repaid. Why did you part from the mothers who nursed you as babies. It was peaceful and you slept and there you stayed. Still he explores and rakes the absinthe green oceans. Though his mother has given him up for lost. Grinning and cursing with a few odd tears of contrition. Always in search of that land where life seems best. Loafing through hells and flocked through paradises. Calm and grinning, with a vanishing face. At times he still dreams of a small field he recognises."

He protected you and me from evil women like poor Alice D. Alice was the girl that all the hippies dread. And they called her sweet Alice the head. Alice it was plain to see, was full of pot and STD. She'd attract a great big crowd, because her inner piece was much too loud. Good Buzz did the thing that all the good Buzz must. Stuck his gun in Alice's back and said This is a Buzz. Shone the flashlight in her eyes, she began to hypnotise. Buzz said What a wild sensation, guess this must be hallucination. Love is so sensational, when you fall in love with eyes dilational. Now they're taking pills in shops, Buzz is not afraid of what. Buzz and Alice D have shown the way of where the Buzz might be some day. Buzz is still a cop of course, he's the pusher on the porch."

Visions of swastikas in my head. Plans for everyone. It's in the white of my eyes. My little China Girl. You shouldn't mess with me. I'll ruin everything you are. You know;. I'll give you television.

I can't see the bridge. for the rain in my eye. Ahhh.... And the world is full of life. Full of folk who don't know me. And they walk in twos or threes or mor. While the light that shines above the grocer's store. Investigates my face so rudely. And my essays lying scattered on the floor. Fulfill their needs just by being there. And my hands shake, my head hurts,. my voice sticks inside my throat. I'm invisible and dumb,. And no-one will recall me. And I can't see the water. through the tears in my ey-y-yes."

0,david-bowie,Cygnet Committee,"I bless you madly, sadly as I tie my shoes. I love you badly, just in time, at times, I guess. Because of you I need to rest. Because it's you that sets the test. So much has gone and little is new. And as the sparrow sings. Dawn chorus for. Someone else to hear. The Thinker sits alone growing older. And so bitter. I gave Them life. I gave Them all. They drained my very soul...dry. I crushed my heart to ease Their pains. No thought for me remains there. Nothing can They spare. What of me?. Who praised Their efforts to be free?. Words of strength and care and sympathy. I opened doors that would have blocked Their way. I braved Their cause to guide, for little pay. I ravaged at my finance just for Those. Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility. Those who said a new world, new ways ever free. Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me. I bless you madly, sadly as I tie my shoes. I love you badly, just in time, at times, I guess. Because of you I need to rest, oh yes. Because it's you that sets the test. So much has gone and little is new. And as the sunrise stream. Flickers on me,. My friends talk. Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word. We had a friend, a talking man. Who spoke of many powers he had. Not of the best of men, but Ours. We used him. We let him use his powers. We let him fill Our needs. Now We are strong. And the road is coming to its end. Now the damned have no time to make amends. No purse of token fortune stands in Our way. The silent guns of love will blast the sky. We broke the ruptured structure built of age. Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage. Where money stood. We planted seeds of rebirth. And stabbed the backs of fathers. Sons of dirt. Infiltrated business cesspools. Hating through Our sleeves. Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat. Stoned the poor on slogans such as. Wish You Could Hear. Love Is All We Need. Kick Out The Jams. Kick Out Your Mother. Cut Up Your Friend. Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End. And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above. And We Can Force You to Be Free. And We Can Force You to Believe. And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain. For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain. For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain. It said. I believe in the Power of Good. I Believe in the State of Love. I Will Fight For the Right to be Right. I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right. And I open my eyes to look around. And I see a child laid slain on the ground. As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows. Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command. But not hearing anymore. Not hearing anymore. Just the shrieks from the old rich. And I Want to Believe. In the madness that calls now. And I want to Believe. That a light's shining through. Somehow. And I Want to Believe. And You Want to Believe. And We Want to Believe. And We Want to Live. Oh, We Want to Live. We Want to Live. We Want to Live. We Want to Live. We Want to Live. We Want to Live. I Want to Live. I Want to Live. I Want to Live. I Want to Live. I Want to Live. I Want to Live. Live. Live. Liiive"

When here was love in the eyes of just one girl. That day, that precious day. When even a fool learns to love. But Oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream. Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed. With thunderous applause looked down from above. On a clown and an angel so much in love. I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream. And even a fool learns to love. That day, that hateful day. The joke turned stale, the game was over. Those spiteful words Oh, go away. Who wants to play?. It's getting late now.. My world, my funny world. Had lost its mask and shown a broken heart. A time, a sour time. When even a fool learns to love. But Oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream. Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed. With thunderous applause looked down from above.

Cried so much his face was wet. then I knew he was not lying. I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies. I saw boys, toys electric irons and T.V.'s. My brain hurt like a warehouse. it had no room to spare. I had to cram so many things. to store everything in there. And all the fat-skinny people,. and all the tall-short people. And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people. I never thought I'd need so many people. A girl my age went off her head. hit some tiny children. If the black hadn't a-pulled her off,. I think she would have killed them. A soldier with a broken arm,. fixed his stare to the wheel of a Cadillac. A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest. and a queer threw up at the sight of that. I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour. drinking milk shakes cold and long. Smiling and waving and looking so fine. don't think you knew you were in this song. And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor. And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there. Your face, your race, the way that you talk. I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk. We've got five years, stuck on my eyes. We've got five years, what a surprise. We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot.

And red mutant eyes gaze down on Hunger City. No more big wheels. Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats. And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes. Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers. Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue. Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now legwarmers. Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald. Any day now."

Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons over its web,. In weeks creating a macabre. Shrine of remains. Its web was also unique in that it had many layers,. Like floors in a buuilding. At the top of this palace-like place, assembled with almost apparent. Care, were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew-drops.. One could almost call it an altar.. When the breeze blew thru this construction,. It produced sounds of wailing, crying.. Tiny wails, tiny cries.. The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically. For their mother.. But the Glass Spider would have long gone, having known that the babies. Would survive someone on their own.. Oh-The Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like-a human's.. They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries.. Don't you hear this wasted cry, Life is over you. (Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone). But you've seen who's in heaven. Is there anyone in hell. (Mummy come back 'cause it's dark now). Take care, take care.. (Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone). Somewhere she glows divine. Somewhere she wakes alone.. But you, you've promise in your lovin' eye. God it's dark now.. Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah. Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah. Gone, Gone the water's all gone. Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone. Stay low on the ground, fire can drive you, savage and afraid. Spitting the dawn, come come come along before the animals awake. Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left.. If your mother don't love you then the riverbed might. Gone, gone, the water's all gone. Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone. Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah. Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah.

0,david-bowie,God Knows I'm Good,"I was walking through the counters of a national concern. And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder. And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean. As the merchandise exchanged and money roared. And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak. Into the paper bag at her side. And her face was white with fear in case her actions. were observed. So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind. Crying. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good. God may look the other way today. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good. God may look the other way today. Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag. Perspiration trickled down her forehead. And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder. She was led away bewildered and amazed. Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter. As her escort asked her softly for her name. And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady. Who had fainted to the whirling wooden floor. Crying. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good. Surely God won't look the other way. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good.

I was open to pain and crossed by the rain. And I walked on a crooked crutch. I strolled all alone through a fallout zone. Came out with my soul untouched. I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd. But when they said 'Sit down' I stood up. Ooh-ohh ooh hoo growin' up. The flag of piracy flew from my mast. My sails were set wing to wing. I had a jukebox graduate for first mate. She couldn't sail but she sure could sing. I pushed the B-52 and bombed em with the blues. With my gear set stubborn on standing. I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school. Never once gave thought to landing, no. I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd. But when they said Come down I threw up. Ooh-ooh growin' up. I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere. And you know it's really hard to hold your breath. And I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared. I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress. Well my feet finally took root in the earth. But I got me a nice little place in the stars. And I swear I found the key to the universe. In the engine of an old parked car. I hid in the mother breast of the crowd. But when they said move down I moved up. Ooh ooh ooh, don't you know that I'm growin' up."

Though I eat from tins, I'm healthier. Though I live in slums, I'm purer than you, my friend. Too bad, I'm not losing sleep. [Too bad] I'm just counting sheep. [Too bad] I'm not losing sleep, my friend. Look around and see the friends. The ones you left, our friends deserted. See the guys that used to talk and drink with you. Don't look down your nose at me. 'Cause I won't ask your sympathy. I won't be your yes-sir man for anything. Too bad, I'm not losing sleep. [Too bad] I'm just counting sheep. [Too bad] I'm not losing sleep, my friend. I would walk with you. Talk with you, drink with you. If you drop that halo that you're wearing on the ground. Too bad, I'm not losing sleep. [Too bad] I'm just counting sheep. [Too bad] I'm not losing sleep, my friend. I can't get my satisfaction. Knowing you won't get reaction. What makes me the big attraction anyway. It's too bad, I'm not losing sleep. [Too bad] I'm just counting sheep. [Too bad] I'm not losing sleep, my friend. Too bad, I'm not losing sleep. [Too bad] I'm just counting sheep.

Trying to keep a straight course is not easy. Somebody special. Looking at me. Same kind of reaction. Wanted to crie with me. Lived here and there. It's too easy to say. But the service just a game a game-ame-ame-ame. I would do anything for you. I would come all day. I would swim all the oceans blue hu. I would walk a thousand miles. Reveal my secrets. More than enough for me to share. I will put roses around the door. Sit in the garden. Growing potatoes by the score. Shake your head girl, with your ponytail. Takes me right back [when you were young]. Throw your precious gifts into the air. Watch them fall down [when you were young]. Your love - feel you put them on the ground. It use to fall apart [when you were young]. Your love - feel you put them on the ground. The hills were higher [when you were young]. Your love - feel you put them on the ground. The trees were taller then [when you were young]. Your love - feel you put them on the ground. The grass was greener [when you were young]. Your love could feel you with devotion."

And meet me across the river. Just shoots and ladders and this is the kiss. American Anna, fantastic Alsatian. From nowhere to nothing. And I go way back. Children swarm like thousands of bugs. Towards the lights the beacons above the hill. The stars to the West, the South, the North and to the East. Now you could say I've got a gift of sorts. A fear of rear windows and swinging doors. A love of violence and dread of sighs. If you can see me I can see you. If you can see me I can see you. I have seen these bairns wave their fists at God. Swear to destroy the beasts, stamping the ground. In their excitement for tomorrow. I could wear your new blue shoes. I should wear your old red dress. And walk to the crossroads. So take this knife. And meet me across the river. I will take your lands and all that lays beneath. The dust of cold flowers, prison of dark of ashes. I will slaughter your kind who descend from belief. I am the spirit of greed, a lord of theft. I'll burn all your books. And the problems they make. If you can see me I can see you. If you can see me"

In the shadow I'll clip your wings. And I'll tell you I love you. In the heat of the morning. I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze. Light my candle from the sun.

0,david-bowie,It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City,"I had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a cobra. I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a super-nova. I could walk like Brando right into the sun, an' dance just like a Casanova. With my black-jack and jacket and my hair slicked sweet. Silver studs on my duds just like a Harley in heat. When I strut down the street I can hear its' heartbeat. The sisters fell back and said Don't that man look pretty. The cripple on the corner cried out Penny, nickels for your pity. Them gasoline boys down-town, they sure talk gritty. It's so hard to be a saint in the city. I was the king of the alley, mama, I could talk some trash. I was the Prince of the Paupers, crowned down-town at the Beggars' Bash. I was a pimps main prophet, I kept everything cool. Just a back-street gambler with the luck to lo..ose. And when the heat came down it was left on the ground, mama. Devil appeared to me like Jesus through the steam in the street, an'. Showed me a hand that even the cops couldn't beat. And I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat, and It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a poor bo..oy out on the street. And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead. As the tracks clack out the rhythm, the eyes fixed straight ahead. They ride the line of balancin', hold on by just a thread. Well, it's too hot in these tunnels, you can get hit up by the heat. When you get up to get out at your next stop, but they push you right down in your seat. And your heart starts beatin' faster as you struggle to your feet. Then you're out of that hole!, back on the street. And them south-side sisters, they sure look pretty. And the cripple on the corner cries out Nickels for your pity. And them down-town boys, they sure talk gritty."

She could've been a killer if she didn't walk the way she do, and she do. She opened strange doors that we'd never close again. She began to wail jealousies scream. Waiting at the light know what I mean. Chorus: (twice). Scary monsters, super creeps. Keep me running, running scared. She asked me to stay and I stole her room. She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind. Now she's stupid in the street and she can't socialise. Well I love the little girl and I'll love her till the day she dies. She wails. Jimmy's guitar sound jealousies scream. Waiting at the light know what I mean. (Chorus) (twice). (Chorus) (twice). Oh oh woh-oh. Oh, oh-oh-oh oh. Oh oh oh, oh oh. Ashes To Ashes. Do you remember a guy that's been. In such an early song. I've heard a rumour from Ground Control. Oh no, don't say it's true. They got a message from the Action Man. I'm happy, hope you're happy too. I've loved all I've needed to love. Sordid details following. The shrieking of nothing is killing. Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I. Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair. But I'm hoping to kick but the planet it's glowing. Chorus:. Ashes to ashes, funk to funky. We know Major Tom's a junkie. Strung out in heaven's high. Hitting an all-time low. Time and again I tell myself. I'll stay clean tonight. But the little green wheels are following me. Oh no, not again. I'm stuck with a valuable friend. I'm happy, hope you're happy too. One flash of light but no smoking pistol. I never done good things. I never done bad things. I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh. Want an axe to break the ice. Wanna come down right now. (Chorus). Repeat. My mother said to get things done. You'd better not mess with Major Tom. Fashion. There's a brand new dance but I don't know its name. That people from bad homes do again and again. It's big and it's bland full of tension and fear. They do it over there but we don't do it here.

Well, how come you only want tomorrow. With its promise of something hard to do. A real life adventure worth more than pieces of gold. Blue skies above and sun on your arms strength in your stride. And hope in those squeaky clean eyes. You'll get chilly receptions everywhere you go. Blinded with desire - guess the season is on. So you train by shadow boxing, search for the truth. But it's all, but it's all used up. Break open your million dollar weapon. And push your luck, still you push, still you push your luck. A broken nosed mogul are you. One of the new wave boys. Same old thing in brand new drag. Comes sweeping into view, oh-ooh. As ugly as a teenage millionaire. Pretending it's a whizz kid world. You'll take me aside, and say. Well, David, what shall I do?. They wait for me in the hallway. I'll say Don't ask me, I don't know any hallways. But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner. I feel like a group of one, no-no. They can't do this to me. I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife. Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes. The word is that the hunted one is out there on his own. You're alone for maybe the last time. And you breathe for a long time. Then you howl like a wolf in a trap. And you daren't look behind. You fall to the ground like a leaf from the tree. And look up one time at that vast blue sky. Scream out aloud as they shoot you down. No no, I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife. I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife. And no one will have seen and no one will confess. The fingerprints will prove that you coudn't pass the test. There'll be others on the line filing past, who'll whisper low. I miss you he really had to go. Well each to his own, he was. Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-ohh. Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-ohh. Another piece of teenage wild.... Wild. Wild. Wild. Scream Like A Baby. Well I wouldn't buy no merchandise. And I wouldn't go to war. And I mixed with other colours. But the nurse doesn't care. And I hide under blankets. Or did I run away. I really can't remember. Last time I saw the light of day. But I remember Sam 'cause he was like me. Chorus:. Scream like a baby. Sam was a gun. And I never knew his last name. And we never had no fun. Well they came down hard on the faggots. And they came down hard on the street. They came down harder on Sam. And they all knew he was beat. He was thrown into the wagon. Blindfolded, chains, and they stomped on us. And took away our clothes and things. And pumped us full of strange drugs. And oh I saw Sam falling. Spitting in their eyes. But now I lay me down to sleep. And now I close my eyes. Now I'm learning to be a part of soc-society. (Chorus). No athletic program, no discipline, no book. He just sat in the backseat swearing he'd seek revenge. But he jumped into the furnace. Singing old songs we loved. (Chorus) (twice). Kingdom Come. Well I walked in the pouring rain. And I heard a voice that cries It's all in vain. The voice of doom was shining in my room. I just need one day somewhere far away. Lord I just need one day. Well I'll be breaking these rocks. And cutting this hay. Yes I'll be breaking these rocks. What's my price to pay. Well the river's so muddy, but it may come clear. And I know too well what's keeping me here. I'm just the slave of a burning ray. Oh give me the night, I can't take another sight. Please, please give me the night. Chorus. Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high. Up in the tower they're watching me hoping I'm gonna die. I won't be breaking no rocks. I said I won't be breaking no rocks. (I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh. (I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh. (I won't be breaking no rocks). When the kingdom comes (repeat ad inf). Because You're Young. Psychodelicate girl - come out to play. Little metal faced-boy - don't stay away. They're so war-torn and resigned she can't talk any more. What are they trying to prove?. What would they like to find?. It's love back to front and no sides - like I say. These pieces are broken - like I say. These pieces are broken. Hope I'm wrong but I know. Chorus:. Because you're young - you'll meet a stranger some night. Because you're young - what could be nicer for you and it makes me sad. So I'll dance my life away. A million dreams, a million scars. He punishes hard - was loving her such a crime. She took back everything she said. Left him nearly out of his mind. They're people I know - people I love. They seem so unhappy - dead or alive. It's love back to front and no sides - like I say. These pieces are broken - like I say. These pieces are broken. Hope I'm wrong but I know. (Chorus). A million dreams. A million scars. A million (repeat ad inf.). It's No Game (Part 2). Silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution. No more free steps to heaven. Just walkie-talkie - heaven or hearth. Just big heads and drums - full speed and pagan. And it's no game. I am barred from the event. I really don't understand the situation. So where's the moral. People have their fingers broken. To be insulted by these fascists it's so degrading. And it's no game. Documentaries on refugees, couples 'gainst the target. Throw a rock against the road, and it breaks into pieces. Draw the blinds on yesterday, and it's all so much scarier. Put a bullet in my brain, and it makes all the papers. And it's no game. Children round the world, put camel shit on the walls.

You won't feel so good now that you've joined the gang. Molly is the model in the ads. Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip. Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong. Cause she can't switch off now that she's joined the gang. Arthur is a singer with a band. Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage. Look at Arthur rave, all the kids are paid. They want to see the croaking man who joined the gang. You won't be alone, we've all got beery grins. It's a big illusion but at least you're in. At least you're in. This club's called The Webb, it's this month's pick. Next month we shall find a place where prices aren't so stiff. 15 bob a coke, 'fraid that's past a joke. This is how to spend now that you've joined the gang. This is what to do now that you're here. Sit round doing nothing all together very fast. Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars."

Every child's mother holds an ice-cream cone, they circle round. Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in the tent where no one goes. A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor he's clogged and clothed in saffron robes. His beads are all he owns. Slow down, slow down. Someone must have said that slow him down. Slow down, slow down. It's pictured on the arms of the Karma Man. Fairy tale skin, depicting scenes from human zoos. Impermanent toys like peace and war a gentle face you've seen before. Karma Man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life. I see my times and who I've been I only live now and I don't know why. I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but. All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin. Slow down, slow down. Someone must have said that slowed him down. Slow down, slow down. It's pictured on the arms of the Karma Man.

One open wound, wasted and drawn. No sympathy. This furious reign. I lay in bed. The monster fed, the body bled. I turned and said. I get some of you all the time. All of you some other time. This rage in me. Get away from me. I'm falling, man. I'm choking, man. I'm fading, man. And a broken line. I'm falling, man. I'm choking, man. I'm fading, man. Just killing a little time.

We claimed the very source of joy ran through. It didn't, but it seemed that way. I kissed a lot of people that day. Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon. To paint that love upon a white balloon. And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops. That man has pushed beyond his brain. Satori must be something just the same. We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size. We talked with tall Venusians passing through. And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head. And away they soared. Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud. Someone passed some bliss among the crowd. And We walked back to the road, unchained.

Somewhere, someone's calling me. When the chips are down. I'm just a travelling man. Maybe it's just a trick of the mind, but. Somewhere there's a morning sky. Bluer than her eyes. Somewhere there's an ocean. Innocent and wild. Africa is sleepy people. Russia has its horsemen. Spent some nights in old Kyoto. Sleeping on the matted ground. Cyprus is my island. When the going's rough. I would love to find you. Somewhere in a place like that. Somewhere, someone's calling me. When the chips are down. I stumble like a blind man. Can't forget you. Can't forget you. Feeling like a shadow. Drifting like a leaf. I stumble like a blind man. Can't forget you. Can't forget you. Can't forget you"

I absolutely love you. But we're absolute beginners. But if my love is your love. We're certain to succeed"

Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph. He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone. Panic in Detroit (oh oh oh aahh, oh oh oh aahh). He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom. The police had warned of repercussions. They followed none too soon. A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive. Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph. He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone. Panic in Detroit (oh oh oh aahh, ah ah ah aahh). Putting on some clothes I made my way to school. (oh oh oh). And I found my teacher crouching in his overalls. I screamed and ran to smash my favourite slot machine (oh oh oh). And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights. Having scored a trillion dollars, made a run back home. Found him slumped across the table. A gun and me alone. I ran to the window. Looked for a plane or two. Panic in Detroit. He'd left me an autograph. Let me collect dust. I wish someone would phone. Panic in Detroit. Panic in Detroit. Panic in Detroit."

Till the war came along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot. And in this little yard, there's a little old man. With a little shovel in his little bitty hand. He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves. He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home. Ah-choo ! excuse me. Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed. As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed. Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care. If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair. And you put it in your pocket. God, it's pouring down. Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy. She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys. And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell. So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket. Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day , st ....ah choo !. Standing in the same spot by a certain grave. Mary-Ann was only 10, full of life and oh so gay. And I was the wicked man who took her life away. Very selfish, Oh God. No, Mr. GD, you won't tell.

In the port of Amsterdam. There's a sailor who sleeps. While the river bank weeps. To the old willow tree. In the port of Amsterdam. There's a sailor who dies. Full of beer, full of cries. In a drunken town fight. In the port of Amsterdam. There's a sailor who's born. On a hot muggy morn. By the dawn's early light. In the port of Amsterdam. Where the sailors all meet. There's a sailor who eats. Only fish heads and tails. And he'll show you his teeth. That have rotted too soon. That can haul up the sails. That can swallow the moon. And he yells to the cook. With his arms open wide. Hey, bring me more fish. Throw it down by my side. And he wants so to belch. But he's too full to try. So he stands up and laughs. And he zips up his fly. . In the port of Amsterdam. You can see sailors dance. Paunches bursting their pants. Grinding women to porch. They've forgotten the tune. That their whiskey voice croaked. Splitting the night. With the roar of their jokes. And they turn and they dance. And they laugh and they lust. Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts. And then out of the night. With their pride in their pants. And the sluts that they tow. Underneath the street lamps. In the port of Amsterdam. There's a sailor who drinks. And he drinks and he drinks. And he drinks once again. He'll drink to the health. Of the whores of Amsterdam. Who've given their bodies. To a thousand other men. Yeah, they've bargained their virtue. Their goodness all gone. For a few dirty coins. Well he just can't go on. Throws his nose to the sky. And he aims it up above. And he pisses like I cry. On the unfaithful love. In the port of Amsterdam. In the port of Amsterdam."

As if she were a dream that must not fade. Above us in the shining summer heaven. There was a cloud my eyes dwelled long upon. It was quite white and very high above us. Then I looked up. And found that it had gone. And since that day, so many moons in silence. Have swum across the sky and gone below. The plum trees surely have been chopped for firewood. And if you ask, how does that love seem now. I must admit, I really can't remember. And yet I know what you are trying to say. But what her face was like, I know no longer. I only know I kissed it on that day. As for the kiss, I long ago forgot it. But for the cloud that floated in the sky. I know that still and shall forever know it. It was quite white and moved in very high. It may be that the plum trees still are blooming. That woman's seventh child may now be there. And yet that cloud had only bloomed for minutes.

These are children riding naked on their tourist pals. While the hollows that pass for eyes swell from withdrawal. And he lies on a mattress in a rat infested room. Talking 'bout his family and the cold back home. CHORUS. Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable. Noone over here reads the papers pal. 'Tween the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable. He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls. A small black someone jumps over the crazy white guard. Cranking up the volume of a Michael Jackson song. CHORUS. Where the frangipani scents the air. She mouths a word that breaks his stare. He grunts his reply in a garrulous croak. That's a mighty big word for a nine year old. CHORUS. Shopping for girls, shopping for girls. You gaze down into her eyes for a million miles. You wanna give her a name and a clean rag doll"

New love - a boy and girl they talking. New words - that only they can share in. New words - a love so strong it tears their hearts. To sleep - through the fleeting hours of morning.

All I have is my love of love - and love is not loving. Soul love - the priest that tastes the word and. Told of love - and how my God on high is. All love - though reaching up my loneliness evolves. By the blindness that surrounds him. Love is careless in its choosing - sweeping over cross a baby. Love descends on those defenseless. Idiot love will spark the fusion.

But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner. I feel like a group of one, no-no. They can't do this to me. I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife. Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes. The word is that the hunted one is out there on his own. You're alone for maybe the last time. And you breathe for a long time. Then you howl like a wolf in a trap. And you daren't look behind. You fall to the ground like a leaf from the tree. And look up one time at that vast blue sky. Scream out aloud as they shoot you down. No no, I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife. I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife. And no one will have seen and no one will confess. The fingerprints will prove that you coudn't pass the test. There'll be others on the line filing past, who'll whisper low. I miss you he really had to go. Well each to his own, he was.

As if it was acting as her body's guardian. Wreck and duck weed slowly increased her weight. By clasping her in their slimy grip. Through her limbs, the cold blooded fishes played. Creatures and plant life kept on, thus obstructing her last trip. And the sky that same evening grew dark as smoke. And its stars through the night kept the brightness still soaring. But it quickly grew clear when dawn now broke. To see that she got one further morning. Once her pallid trunk had rotted beyond repair. It happened quite slowly that she gently slipped from God's thoughts. First with her face, then her hands, right at the last with her hair."

We claimed the very source of joy ran through. It didn't, but it seemed that way. I kissed a lot of people that day. Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon. To paint that love upon a white balloon. And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops. That man has pushed beyond his brain. Satoria must be something just the same. We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size. We talked with tall Venusians passing through. And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head. And away they soared. Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud. Someone passed some bliss among the crowd. And We walked back to the road, unchained. The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party, ha ha ha. (repeat 25 times). The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party, yeah yeah.

There is no hell. Like an old hell. There is no hell. And it's lights up, boys. Lights up boys. Explosion falls upon deaf ears. While we're swimming in a sea of sham. Living in the shadow of vanity. A complex fashion for a simple man. And there is no hell. And there is no shame. And there is no hell. Like an old hell. There is no hell. And the silence flies on its brief flight. A razor sharp crap shoot affair. And we light up our lives. And there's no more of me exploding you. Re-exposing you. Like everybody do. Re-exploding you. I don't know what to use.

And the priest stiff in hate. Now demanding fun begin. Of his women dressed as men. For the pleasure of that priest. Here I am. Not quite dying. My body left to rot in a hollow tree. Its branches throwing shadows. On the gallows for me. And the next day. And the next. And another day. Ignoring the pain of their particular diseases. They chase him through the alleys. Chase him down the steps. They haul him through the mud and they chant for his death. And drag him to the feet of the purple headed priest. First they give you everything that you want. Then they take back everything that you have. They live upon their feet and they die upon their knees. They can work with Satan. While they dress like the saints. They know God exists for the Devil told them so. They scream my name aloud down into the well below. Here I am. Not quite dying. My body left to rot in a hollow tree. Its branches throwing shadows.

They burn you with their radiant smiles. Trap you with their beautiful eyes. They're broke and shamed. Or drunk or scared. But I hope they live forever. Their jealousy's spilling down.

And gloomy browed with superfear their tragic endless lives. Could heave nor sigh. In solemn, perverse serenity, wondrous beings chained to life. Strange games they would play then. No death for the perfect men. Life rolls into one for them. So softly a supergod cries. Where all were minds in uni-thought. Power weird by mystics taught. No pain, no joy, no power too great. Colossal strength to grasp a fate. Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers. Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold. A man would tear his brother's flesh, a chance to die. To turn to mold.. Far out in the red-sky. Far out from the sad eyes. Strange, mad celebration. So softly a supergod cries. Far out in the red-sky. Far out from the sad eyes. Strange, mad celebration. So softly a supergod dies."

And the prayers were small and yellow. And the rumour spread that I was aging fast. Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping. By a tree. And I looked and frowned and the monster was me. Well, I said hello and I said hello. And I asked Why not? and I replied I don't know. So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be. And he laughed insane and quipped KAHLIL GIBRAN. And I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through. For I realized that God's a young man too. Ho. Oh I said So long and I waved Bye-bye. And I smashed my soul and traded my mind. Got laid by a young bordello. Who was vaguely half asleep. For which my reputation swept back home in drag. And the moral of this magic spell. Negotiates my hide. When God did take my logic for a ride. (Riding along). Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oooooh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooooh. He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips. And showed me the leather belt round his hips. My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame. He said You'll never go down to the Gods again. (Turn around, go back!). He struck the ground a cavern appeared. And I smelt the burning pit of fear. We crashed a thousand yards below. I said Do it again, do it again. (Turn around, go back!). His nebulous body swayed above. His tongue swollen with devil's love. The snake and I, a venom high. I said Do it again, do it again. (Turn around, go back!). Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply. And I was seething, breathing deeply. Spitting sentry, horned and tailed.

And the last thing on his mind. Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned. Neath the covered wooden shaft. Folds the rope. Into its bag. Blows his pipe of smolders. Blankets smoke into the room. And the day will end for some. As the night begins for one. Staring through the message in his eyes. Lies a solitary son. From the mountain called Freecloud. Where the eagle dare not fly. And the patience in his sigh. Gives no indication. For the townsmen to decide. So the village Dreadful yawns. Pronouncing gross diversion. As the label for the dog. Oh It's the madness in his eyes. As he breaks the night to cry. It's really Me. Really You. And really Me. It's so hard for us to really be. Really You. And really Me. You'll lose me though I'm always really free. And the mountain moved its eyes. To the world of realize. Where the snow had saved a place. For the Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud. And the village dreadful cried. As the rope began to rise. For the smile stayed on the face. Of the wild eyed boy from freecloud. And the women once proud. Clutched the heart of the crowd. As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand. And the Magic in the stare. Of the Wild Eyed Boy, said. Stop, Freecloud. They won't think to cut me down. But the cottages fell. Like a playing card hell. And the tears on the face. Of the Wise Boy. Came trembling down. To the rumbling ground. And the missionary mystic of peace/love. Stumbled to cry among the clouds. Kicking back the pebbles."

Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street. Back to mother, it's another empty day. Uncle Arthur likes his mommy. Uncle Arthur still reads comics. Uncle Arthur follows Batman. Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum. On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum. Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed. Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion. Sally was the real thing, not just lust. Uncle Arthur vanished quickly. Uncle Arthur and his new bride. Uncle Arthur follows Sally. Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days. Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze. Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled. Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop. He gets his pocket money, he's well fed. Uncle Arthur past the gasworks. Uncle Arthur past the river. Uncle Arthur down the high street."

I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid. Pressing our love through the night. Knowing it's right, knowing it's right. Now I'm hoping someone will care. Living on the breath of a hope to be shared. Trusting on the sons of our love. That someone will care, someone will care. But now. We're today's scrambled creatures, locked in tomorrow's double feature. Heaven's on the pillow, its silence competes with hell. It's a twenty-four hour service, guaranteed to make you tell. And the streets are full of press men. Bent on getting hung and buried. And the legendary curtains are drawn 'round Baby Bankrupt. Who sucks you while you're sleeping. It's the theater of financiers. Count them, fifty 'round a table. White and dressed to kill. Oh caress yourself, my juicy. For my hands have all but withered. Oh dress yourself my urchin one, for I hear them on the stairs. Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said. We are the dead. We are the dead"

We will only love each other as forever. When I live my dream. When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me. And the empty man you left behind. It's a broken heart that dreams, it's a broken heart you left me. Only love can live in my dream. I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish. Wish, and the storm will fade away. Wish again, and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an overture. And trees will play the rhythm of my dream. When I live my dream, please be there to meet me. Let me be the one to understand. When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave me. Then we can live in our new land. Till the day my dream cascades around me. I'm content to let you pass me by. Till that day, you'll run to many other men. But let them know it's just for now. Tell them that I've got a dream. And tell them you're the starring role. Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy. And I'm going to make my dream. Tell them I will live my dream. Tell them they can laugh at me. But don't forget your date with me."

Did you actually become. The center of my world. The seams of my life. The streams of daydream. Like the wounds of a friend. Another the kiss of a foe. The pack of a blackened eye. A life or the crown. When I met you. I could not speak. How I met you. Then I met you. My spirit grows. My kind of truth. Could not exist. When I met you. How it's all the same. It's all the same. The sun is gone. It's all the same. But when I met you. When I met you. When I met you. When I met you. When I met you. When I met you. I was the walking dead. I was kicked in the head. It was such a time. It was such a time. I was crushed inside. I was torn inside. When I met you. When I met you. I was too insane. Could not trust a thing. I was off my head. I was filled with truth. It was not god's truth. Before I met you

'Cause I'm only four and grown-ups walk too fast. Yesterday was horrid day, 'cause Raymond kicked my shin. And mummy says if I am good, she'll let me go to school in August. Daddy shouted loud at mummy and I dropped my toast at breakfast. And I laughed when Bonzo licked my face, because it tickled. I wonder why my daddy cries and how I wish that I was nearly five. When I'm five. I will catch a butterfly and eat it and I won't be sick. When I'm five. I will jump in puddles, laugh in church and marry my mum. And I'll let my daddy do the washing-up. If I close one eye, the people on that side can't see me. I get headaches in the morning and I rode on Freddie's tricycle. And everywhere was funny, when I ran down to the sweetshop. Then I fell and bleeded-up my knee and everybody soppied me. I saw a photograph of Jesus and I asked him if he'd make me five. I saw a photograph of Jesus and I asked him if he'd make me five.

0,david-bowie,Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud,"Solemn faced, the village settles down, undetected by the stars. And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep. And the last thing on his mind. Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned neath the covered wooden shaft. Folds the rope into its bag. Blows his pipe of smolders, blankets smoke into the room. And the day will end for some as the night begins for one. Staring through the message in his eyes, lies a solitary son. From the mountain called Freecloud where the eagle dare not fly. And the patience in his sigh. gives no indication for the townsmen to decide. So the village Dreadful yawns. pronouncing gross diversion as the label for the dog. oh it's the madness in his eyes as he breaks the night to cry. It's really me. Really you and really me. It's so hard for us to really be. Really you and really me. You'll lose me though I'm always really free. And the mountain moved its eyes. To the world of realize. Where the snow had saved a place. For the Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud. And the village Dreadful cried. As the rope began to rise. For the smile stayed on the face. Of the Wild Eyed Boy from freecloud. And the women once proud clutched the heart of the crown. As the boulders smashed down from the mountains hand. And the magic in the stare of the Wild Eyed Boy said. Stop, freecloud! They won't think to cut me down. But the cottages fell like the playing card hell. The tears on the face of a Wise Boy. Came trembling down to the rumbling ground. And the missionary mystic of peace/love. Stumbled back to cry among the clouds. Kicking back the pebbles. From the Freecloud mountain track."

Love is thrown in airless rooms. Thin vile rewards for you. And I'm gonna tell. Yes, I've gotta tell. Gotta tell the things you've said. When you're talking in the dark. And I'm gonna tell the things you've done. When you're walking through the park. Some night on a thrill-less street. Will come a silent gun. You've got a dangerous part. You stole their trust, their moon, their sun. They'll come such a dart and it's needle on a crowded train. I bet you'll feel so lonely. You could die. Buildings crammed with people, landscape filled with wrath. Grey concrete city, rain has wet the street. I want to see you clearly before you close the door. A room of bloody history, you made sure of that. I can see you as a corpse hanging from a beam. I can read you like a book. I can feel you falling. I hear you moaning in your room. Oh, see if I care. Oh please, please make it soon. Walls have got you cornered. You've got the blues my friend. And people don't like you. But you will leave without a sound or a God, an end. Oh hopefully, I love you. Death along shall love you. I bet you'll feel so lonely you could die. You feel so lonely you could die. You feel so lonely you could die"

All the lonely people. Where do they all come from?. All the lonely people. Where do they all belong?. Ah, look at all the lonely people!. Ah, look at all the lonely people!. Eleanor Rigby died in the church. And was buried along with her name. Nobody came. Father Mckenzie wiping the dirt from his hands. As he walks from the grave. No one was saved. All the lonely people. Where do they all come from?. All the lonely people. (Ah, look at all the lonely people!). Where do they all belong?"

1,paul-mccartney,Back in Brazil,"Back in Brazil, there lives a girl. Dreams of the future, and a far, far better world. Back in Brazil, she meets a man. He's tall and handsome, and he fits in with her plan. Bright lights ahead, music and fun. Nights are for dancing, and the days are for the sun. All kinds of weather will surely come and go. But they're together. And together they will steal the show. Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!. Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!. Ichiba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ban!. Back in Brazil, she makes a date. He has to cancel, 'cause they got him working late. Back in Brazil, she feels afraid. Hope starts to crumble. And her dreams begin to fade. Her lights are out, she's gone to bed. Nights are for sleeping if a girl's to get ahead. Even the weather has started changing too. But they'll be together. And together they will make it through. Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!. Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!. Ichiban!. So we raise a family as the clouds roll by. Making pictures of us in the sky. The kids are happy and they don't ask why. Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa, you and I"

Dark distant mountains with valleys of green.. Past painted deserts. The sunset's on fire. As he carries me home to the mull of kintyre.. Mull of Kintyre. Oh mist rolling in from the sea,. My desire is always to be here. Oh mull of kintyre. Sweep through the heather like deer in the glen. Carry me back to the days I knew then.. Nights when we sang like a heavenly choir. Of the life and the time of the mull of kintyre.. Mull of Kintyre. Oh mist rolling in from the sea,. My desire is always to be here. Oh mull of kintyre. Smiles in the sunshine. And tears in the rain. Still take me back to where my memories remain. Flickering embers growing higher and higher. As they carry me back to the mull of kintyre. Mull of Kintyre. Oh mist rolling in from the sea,. My desire is always to be here. Oh mull of kintyre. Mull of Kintyre. Oh mist rolling in from the sea,. My desire is always to be here"

Shouting at the world. I don't need love. though temptation is sweet. Give me your hand. 'Til I'm back on me feet. You're always telling me about my misery. I've seen things you will never see. Don't pity me. I'll stand up again. Kick up a fuss again too. I'll be right again. Be upright without you. We see a life through the eyes of a man. As he live and he dies. By a simple tattoo. I'll be back again. When I land on my feet. I'll stand up again. Kick up a fuss again, wouldn't you. Well there you go, though we tried hard to know him. It's there on his face. He's a case where there's clearly no hope. Give me your hand again. 'Til I land again. His face starts to fade. As we pull down the shade. And the picture we made. Is in glorious cinemascope."

People struggling to survive. How can peace hope to stay alive?. Well I was there...I felt so good. At the centre of a love vibration.. People caring for their world. Helping each other out..

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar. The little children laugh at him behind his back. And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain.... Very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies. I sit, and meanwhile back. In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass. And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.. He likes to keep his fire engine clean. It's a clean machine. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. Four of fish and finger pies. In summer, meanwhile back. Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout. A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray. And though she feels as if she's in a play. She is anyway. Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer. We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim. Then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain.... Very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies. I sit, and meanwhile back. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies.... Penny Lane."

And I'm not quitting. while people are crying for more. People want peace. People want peace. A simple release from their suffering. People want peace. People want peace. Nothing in life is as sad. As a lonely soul searching for peace. Only to find disappointment is waiting. Behind every door that we open. Every catch we release. Brothers and sisters. I beg you to listen. I know that it isn't too late. For we are the people. The voices of freedom. And we're all perfectly clear that we. Don't want to wait. People want peace. People want peace. A simple release from their suffering. People want peace. People want peace. People want peace. People want peace. People want peace. People want peace"

But I can laugh it off. And act like nothing's wrong. But why pretend. I think I've heard enough. Of your familiar song. I tell you what I'm going to do. I'll try to take my mind off you. And now that you don't need my help. I'll use the time to think about myself. You're not aware. Of what you put me through. But now the feeling's gone. But I don't mind. Do what you have to do. You don't fool anyone. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'll take a different point of view. And now that you don't need my help. I'll use the time to think about myself. The definition of friendship. Apparently ought to be. Showing support for the one that you love. And I was open to friendship. But you didn't seem to have any to spare. While you were riding to Vanity Fair. There was a time. When every day was young. The sun would always shine. We sang along. When all the songs were sung. Believing every line. That's the trouble with friendship. For someone to feel it. It has to be real or it wouldn't be right. And I keep hoping for friendship. But I wouldn't dare to presume it was there. While you were riding to Vanity Fair. . daniboy_sa

1,paul-mccartney,Run Devil Run,Run devil run. The angel's having fun. Making winners out of sinners. Better leave before he's done. When he gets throught he'll be coming after you. Listen what I'm saying to you run. Run devil run. By a swamp in Alabama in the cold and the damp. Sitting reading by the light of a kerosene lamp. Lives a holy roller with a mission on her mind. Got to spread the word to anybody she can find. You can hear her screaming any time of night or day. This is what she says to keep her demons away. Run devil run. The angel's having fun. Making winners out of sinners. Better leave before he's done. When he gets throught he'll be coming after you. Listen what I'm saying to you run. Run devil run. Her brother and her sister said that she brought them down. Stepping on a bus that was heading for town. There they started drinking they got into a fight. The sheriff introduced them to the jailhouse for a night. When the holy roller came to town to pay the bail. This is what she sang as she was leaving the jail. Run devil run. The angel's having fun. Making winners out of sinners. Better leave before he's done. When he gets throught he'll be coming after you. Listen what I'm saying to you run. Run devil run. Well by the middle of the summer they were back at the shack. Picking cotton for a living keeping on the right track. Visiting the neighbours trying to spread the good news. Singing gospel music with a hint of the blues. All of them determined to deliver the goods. Man you hear the music coming out of the woods. Run devil run. The angel's having fun. Making winners out of sinners. Better leave before he's done. When he gets throught he'll be coming after you. Listen what I'm saying to you run. Run devil run. By a swamp in Alabama in the cold and the damp. Sitting reading by the light of a kerosene lamp. Lives a holy roller with a mission on her mind. Got to spread the word to anybody she can find. You can hear her screaming any time of night or day. This is what she says to keep her demons away. Run devil run. The angel's having fun. Making winners out of sinners. Better leave before he's done. When he gets throught he'll be coming after you. Listen what I'm saying to you run. Run devil run. Her brother and her sister said that she brought them down.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase. To kids, from one to ninety-two. Although it's been said many times, many ways. Merry Christmas to you. And so I'm offering this simple phrase.

And it's almost April Fools' Day. As he glanced on his paper looking through the veil. He could see she was really upset. As she tucked back the ribbon in a velvet box. As he offered her a cigarette. Down down down she took a drag. Now he's covered in a flag. Tommy's coming home again. And it's almost April Fools' Day. Almost April Fools' Day. And the joke's on everyone. He had that premonition. Only dead men dwell upon. But how could he know that only twelve months later. She would wear her skirt up over her knee. And in the very same carriage she'd be flattened with roses.

Who cares about you?. I do. 'Cause you're worth much more. A fact you can be sure. No need to hide. The love you've got inside. Did you ever get lost in the heart of a crowd. And the people around. keep on pushing you down?. Is it driving you mad. and you're screaming out loud. And you're wondering. who's going to recognize you. You're a ghost in the dark. Who cares what the idiots say?. Who cares what the idiots do?. Who cares about the pain in your heart?. Who cares about you?. Who cares what the idiots say?. Who cares what the idiots do?. Who cares about the pain in your heart?. Who cares about you?. I do. You've been left in the rain"

From the pages of a paper candles shine. On a perfect table laid for two who love to dine. They suggest a highly recommended wine. Once again the same old line. Why so sad. My fine young friend. Why so blue. Weary carriage horses stand in single file. Someone at a crowded bus stop wears a friendly smile. Touching nerves that no one's heard from in a while. Papers from the same old file. Why so sad. My fine young friend. Why so blue. Sometimes when eyes meet. You know. They have to meet again. Sometimes birds of a feather. Got to fly. Together oh. From a dingy attic window candles shine. On a perfect table laid for two who love to dine. Now they drink the highly recommended wine. Free at last and feeling fine. I'm so glad (I am so glad). My (It's not so bad). fine (It's not the end). young (I am the friend). friend (I am the friend). Glad for you. Well I'm so glad (I'd be so sad).

2,laura-pausini,La Solitudine,"Marco se n'è andato e non ritorna più. E il treno delle 7:30 senza lui. è un cuore di metallo senza l'anima. Nel freddo del mattino grigio di città. A scuola il banco è vuoto, marco è dentro me. è dolce il suo respiro fra i pensiere miei. Distanze enormi sembrano dividerci. Ma il cuore batte forte dentro me. Chissà se tu mi penserai. Se con i tuoi non parli mai. Se ti nascondi come me. Sfuggi gli sguardi e te ne stai. Rinchiuso in camera e non vuoi mangiare. Stringi forte a te il cuscino. Piangi e non lo sai quanto altro male ti farà la solitudine. Marco nel mio diario ho una fotografia. Hai gli occhi di bambino un poco timido. La stringo forte al cuore e sento che ci sei. Fra i compiti d'inglese e matematica. Tuo padre e i suoi consigli che monotonia. Lui con il suo lavoro ti ha portato via. Di certo il tuo parere non l'ha chiesto mai. Ha detto un giorno tu mi capirai. Chissà se tu mi penserai. Se con gli amici parlerai. Per non soffrire più per me. Ma non è facile lo sai. A scuola non ne posso più. E i pomeriggi senza te. Studiare è inutile tutte le idee si affollano su te. Non è possibile dividere la vita di noi due. Ti prego aspettami amore mio.... Ma illuderti non so!. La solitudine fra noi. Questo silenzio dentro me. e l'inquietudine di vivere la vita senza te. Ti prego aspettami perché. Non posso stare senza te. Non è possibile dividere la storia di noi due. La solitudine fra noi. Questo silenzio dentro me. e l'inquietudine di vivere la vita senza te. Ti prego aspettami perché. Non posso stare senza te. Non è possibile dividere la storia di noi due. La solitudine"
2,laura-pausini,Strani Amori,"Mi dispiace devo andare via. Ma sapevo che era una bugia. Quanto tempo perso dietro a lui. Che promette e poi non cambia mai. Strani amori mettono nei guai. Ma, in realtà, siamo noi. E lo aspetti ad un telefono. Litigando che sai libero. con il cuore nel lo stomaco. Un gomitolo nell'angolo. Lì da sola, dentro un brivido. Ma perché lui non c'è. E sono strani amori che. Fanno crescere e sorridere. Fra le lacrime. Quante pagine lì da scrivere. Sogni e lividi da dividere. Sono amori che spesso a questa età. Si confondono dentro a quest'anima. Che si interroga senza decidere. Se è un amore che va per noi. E quante notte perse a piangere. Rileggendo quelle lettere. Che non riesci più a buttare via. Dal labirinto della nostalgia. Grandi amori che finiscono. Ma perché restano nel cuore. Strani amori che vanno e vengono. Nei pensieri che lì nascondono. Storie vere che ci appartengono. Ma si lasciano come noi. Strani amori fragili. Prigionieri, liberi. Strani amori mettono nei guai. Ma, in realtà, siamo noi. Strani amori fragili. Prigionieri, liberi. Strani amori che non sanno vivere. E si perdono dentro noi. Mi dispiace devo andare via. Questa volta l'ho promesso a me. Perché ho voglia ad un amore vero. Senza te"
2,laura-pausini,Incancellabile,A volte mi domando se. Vivrei lo stesso senza te. Se ti saprei dimenticare. Ma passa un attimo e tu sei. Sei tutto quello che vorrei. Incancellabile oramai. Sembrava un'altra storia che. Il tempo porta via con sé. Tu non lasciarmi mai. Tu non lasciarmi.... E più mi manchi. e più tu stai. Al centro dei pensieri miei. Tu non lasciarmi mai. Perché oramai sarai. Incancellabile. Con la tua voce l'allegria. Che dentro me non va più via. Come un tatuaggio sulla pelle. Ti vedo dentro gli occhi suoi. Ti cerco quando non ci sei. Sulle mie labbra sento la voglia che ho di te. Così profondamente mio. Non ho mai avuto niente io. Tu non lasciarmi mai. Tu non lasciarmi.... E più ti guardo e più lo sai. Di te io m'innamorerei. Tu non lasciarmi mai. Tu non lasciarmi. Non farlo mai perché. Se guardo il cielo. Io sento che sarai. Incancellabile oramai. Tu non lasciarmi mai. Tu non lasciarmi.... Incancellabile tu sei. I miei respiri e I giorni miei. Tu non lasciarmi.... E si fa grande. Dentro me. Questo bisogno. Che ho di te. Tu non lasciarmi mai. Tu non lasciarmi.... E più mi manchi e più tu sei. Al centro dei pensieri miei. Tu non lasciarmi mai. Da sola senza te. Ora e per sempre resterai. Dentro I miei occhi.... Incancellabile!
2,laura-pausini,La Soledad,"Marco se ha marchado para no volver. El tren de la mañana llega ya sin él. Es sólo un corazón con alma de metal. En esta niebla gris que envuelve la ciudad. Su banco está vacio, Marco sigue en mí. Le siento respirar pienso que sigue aquí. Ni la distancia enorme puede dividir. Dos corazones y un solo latir. Quizas si tú piensas en mí. Si a nadie tú quieres hablar. Si tú te escondes como yo. Si huyes de todo y si te vas. Pronto a la cama sin cenar. Si aprietas fuerte contra ti. La almohada y te echas a llorar. Si tú no sabes cuanto mal. Te hará la soledad.... Miro en mi diario tu fotografía. Con ojos de un muchacho un poco tímido. La aprieto contra el pecho y me parece que. Estás aquí entre inglés y matemáticas. Tu padre y sus consejos, que monotonía. Por causa del trabajo y otras tonterías. Te ha llevado lejos sin contar contigo. Y ha dicho un día lo comprenderás. Quizas si tú piensas en mí. Con los amigos deverás. Tratando sólo de olvidar. No es nada facil la verdad. En clases ya no puedo más. Y por las tardes es peor. No tengo ganas de estudiar. Por ti mi pensamiento va. Es imposible dividir así. La vida de los dos. Por eso espérame, cariño mío. Conserva la ilusión. La soledad entre los dos. Este silencio en mi interior. Esta inquietud a ver pasar así. La vida sin tu amor. Por eso espérame porque. Esto no puede suceder. Es imposible separar así. La historia de los dos. La soledad entre los dos. Este silencio en mi interior. Esa inquietud a ver pasar así. La vida sin tu amor. Por eso espérame porque. Esto no puede suceder. Es imposible separar así. La historia de los dos. La soledad..."
2,laura-pausini,Se Fué,"Ya no responde ni al teléfono. Pende de un hilo la esperanza mía. Yo no creí jamás poder perder así la cabeza. Por él. Porque de pronto ya no me quería. Porque mi vida se quedó vacía. Nadie contesta mis preguntas, porque. Nada me queda, sin él. Se fue. Se fue, el perfume de sus cabellos. Se fue, el murmullo de su silencio. Se fue, su sonrisa de fábula. Se fue, la dulce miel que probé en sus labios. Se fue, me quedó solo su veneno. Se fue, y mi amor se cubrió de hielo. Se fue, y la vida con él se me fue. se fue, y desde entonces ya solo tengo lágrimas. Encadenada a noches de locura. Hasta a la cárcel yo iría con él. Toda una vida no basta, sin él. En mi verano ya no sale el sol. Con su tormenta, todo destruyó. Rompiendo en mil pedazos. esos sueños que construimos, ayer!. Se fue. Se fue, me quedó solo su veneno. Se fue, y mi amor se cubrió de hielo. Se fue, y la vida con él se me fue. Se fue, y la razón no la sé. Si existe Dios, debe acordarse de mí. Aunque se, que entre él y yo. El cielo tiene solo nubes negras. Le rogaré, le buscaré, lo juro, le encontraré. Aunque tuviera que buscar en un millón de estrellas. En esta vida obscura, absurda sin él. Siento que. Se ha convertido en centro y fin de todo mi universo. Si tiene límite, el amor, lo pasaría por él. Y en el vacío inmenso de mis noches, yo le siento. le amaré. como le pude amar la vez primera. que un beso suyo era una vida entera. sintiendo como me pierdo. por él. Se fue. Se fue, el perfume de sus cabellos. Se fue, el murmullo de su silencio. Se fue, su sonrisa de fábula. Se fue, la dulce miel que probé en sus labios. Se fue, me quedó solo su veneno. Se fue, y mi amor se cubrió de hielo. Se fue, se fue, y la vida con él se me fue. se fue, y la razón no la sé"

Lasciando il vuoto in questa vita mia. Senza risposte ai miei perché. Adesso cosa mi resta di te?. Non c'è... non c'è il profumo della tua pelle. Non c'è... il respiro di te sul viso. Non c'è... la tua bocca di fragola. Non c'è... il dolce miele dei tuoi capelli. Non c'è... che il veleno di te sul cuore. Non c'è... via d'uscita per questo amore. Non c'è... non c'è vita per me, più. Non c'è... non c'è altra ragione che mi liberi l'anima. Incatenata a notti di follia. Anche in prigione me ne andrei per te. Solo una vita non basta per me. E anche l'estate ha le sue nuvole. E tu sei l'uragano contro me. Strappando i sogni nei giorni miei te ne sei andato di fretta perché. Non c'è... non c'è che il veleno di te sul cuore. Non c'è... via d'uscita per questo amore. Non c'è... non c'è vita per me più. Non c'è... non c'è altra ragione per me. Se esiste un Dio no può scordarsi di me anche se. Fra lui e me c'è un cielo nero nero senza fine. Lo pregherò, lo cercherò e lo giuro ti troverò. Dovessi entrare in altre dieci cento mille vite. In questa vita buia senza di te sento che. Ormai per me sei diventato l'unica ragione. Se c'è un confine nell'amore giuro lo passerò. E nell'imenso vuoto di quei giorni senza fine ti amerò. Come la prima volta a casa tua. Ogni tuo gesto mi portava via. Sentivo perdermi dentro di te. Non c'è... non c'è il profumo della tua pelle. Non c'è... il respiro di te sul viso. Non c'è... la tua bocca di fragola. Non c'è... il dolce miele dei tuoi capelli. Non c'è... non c'è il veleno di te nel cuore. Non c'è... non c'è via d'uscita per questo amore. Non c'è... non c'è vita per me più. Non c'è... non c'è altra ragione per me. Non c'è... non c'è il veleno di te nel cuore. Non c'è... non c'è via d'uscita per questo amore. Non c'è... non c'è vita per me più.

Mais que uma história pra viver. O tempo parece dizer. Não, não me deixe mais. Nunca me deixe. Quanto mais longe possa estar. É tudo o que eu quero pensar. Não, não me deixe mais. Porque eu te quero aqui. Inesquecível em mim. Ouço a sua voz e a alegria. Dentro de mim faz moradia. Vira tatuagem sob a pele. Te levo sempre em meu olhar. Não canso de te procurar. Entre meus lábios sinto a falta de você. E assim, profundamente meu. Pra que pensar que existe o adeus. Não, não me deixe mais. Nunca me deixe. Já não preciso nem dizer. O quanto eu me apaixonei. Não, não me deixe mais. Nunca me deixe. E vou dizer porque. Se existe céu. Você sempre será. Inesquecível para amar, oh não! ooh não!. Não, não me deixe mais. Nunca me deixe. Inesquecível é você,. Digo então mais uma vez. Não, não me deixe mais. Nunca me deixe.. oh não! ooh não!. (coro). Tão grande em mim. Sempre vai ser. Essa vontade. De te ter. Não, não me deixe mais.... Nunca me deixe....

E non serve ripetere ancora che tu mi vuoi. Perché ora non c'è quel tuo. Sorriso al mattino per me. Perché non mi dai più niente di te. Seamisai quando tutto finisce. Seamisai come un brivido triste. Come in un film dalle scene già viste. Che se ne va, oh no!. Sai sempre quando una storia si è chiusa. E non si può più inventare una scusa. Se ami prendi le mie mani. Perché prima di domani. Finirà. E non si può. Chiudere gli occhi e far finta di niente. Come fai tu quando resti con me. E non trovi il coraggio di dirmi che cosa c'è. Sarà dentro di me come una notte. D'inverno perché. Sarà da oggi in poi senza di te. Seamisai quando tutto finisce. Seamisai come un brivido triste. Come in un film dalle scene già viste. Che se ne va, oh no!. Sai bene quando inizia il dolore. E arriva la fine più una storia d'amore. Se ami prendi le mie mani. Perché prima di domani. Te ne andrai, non sarai. Qui con me."
2,laura-pausini,Amores Extraños,"Ya sabía que no llegaría. Ya sabía que era una mentira. Cuanto tiempo que por él perdí. Que promesa rota sin cumplir. Son amores problemáticos. Como tú, como yo. Es la espera en un teléfono. La aventura de lo ilógico. La locura de lo mágico. Un veneno sin antídoto. La amargura de lo efímero. Porque él se marchó. Amores, tan extraños que te hacen cínica. Te hacen sonreir entre lágrimas. Cúantas páginas hipotéticas. Para no escribir las auténticas. Son amores que sólo a nuestra edad. Se confunden en nuestros espíritos. Te interrogan y nunca te dejan ver. Si serán amor o placer. Y cúantas noches lloraré por él. Cúantas veces volveré a leer. Aquellas cartas que yo recibía. Cuando mis penas eran alegrías. Son amores esporádicos. Pero en ti quedarán. Amores, tan extraños que vienen y se van. Que en tu corazón sobrevivirán. Son historias que siempre contarás. Sin saber si son de verdad. Son amores frágiles. Prisioneros, cómplices. Son amores problemáticos. Como tú, como yo. Son amores, frágiles. Prisioneros, cómplices. Tan extraños que viven negándose. Escondiéndose de los dos. Ya sabia que no llegaría. Esta vez me lo prometeré. Tengo ganas de un amor sincero. Ya sin él...."

Su banco está vacío, marco sigue vivo. Le siento respirar pienso que sigue aqui. Ni la distancia enorme puede dividir. Dos corazones y un sólo latir. Quizás.... Si tu piensas en mi. Si a nadie tu quieres hablar. Si tu te escondes como yo. Si huyes de todo. Y si te vas. Pronto a la cama sin cenar. Si aprietas fuerte contra ti. La almohada y te echas a llorar. Si tu no sabes cuanto mal. Te hará la soledad.... Nanaira... Nanaira.... Nanaira.... Miro en mi diario tu fotografía. Con ojos de muchacho un poco tímido. La aprieto contra el pecho y me parece que. Estás aquí entre inglés y matemáticas. Tu padre y sus consejos que monotonía. Por causa del trabajo y otras tonterías. Te ha llevado lejos sin contar contigo. Te ha dicho un día lo comprenderás. Quizás.... Si tu piensas en mi. Con los amigos deberás. Tratando sólo de olvidar. No es nada fácil la verdad. En clase ya no puedo más. Y por las tardes es peor. No tengo ganas de estudiar. Por ti mi pensamiento va. Es imposible dividir asi. La vida de los dos. Por eso esperame, cariño mio. Conserva la ilusión. La soledad entre los dos. Este silencio en mi interior. Esa inquietud de ver pasar asi. La vida sin tu amor. Por eso esperame, porque. Esto no puede suceder. Es imposible separar asi. La historia de los dos. La soledad entre los dos. Este silencio en mi interior. Esa inquietud de ver pasar asi. La vida sin tu amor. Por eso esperame, porque. Esto no puede suceder. Es imposible separar asi. La historia de los dos. La soledad...."

La colpa non esiste. Ma ognuno prenda la sua direzione. Perdonami per questi giorni. Non li ho saputi raccontare. Avevo un indirizzo nuovo. E un posto per scappare. E non è detto che mi manchi sempre. Le cose cambiano improvvisamente. E certi angoli di notte non avranno luce mai. E non è detto che non provo niente. Se tengo gli occhi sul tuo sguardo assente. E se mi fido della forza di un ricordo. Casomai. Prenditi l'ombrello. Che sia il riparo sotto la tempesta. Se quello che ti devo. È avere il cuore dalla parte giusta. Perdonami per questi giorni. Non li ho saputi raccontare. Ho un treno verso l'aeroporto. E un volo tra due ore. E non è detto che mi manchi sempre. Le cose cambiano improvvisamente. E certi angoli di notte non avranno luce mai. E non è detto che non provo niente. Se tengo gli occhi sul tuo sguardo assente. Perché mi fido della forza di un ricordo. Casomai. E non è detto, e non è detto. E non è detto, e non è detto. Ma chi l'ha detto che non provo niente. Quello che è stato rimarrà importante. Come la piccola speranza che ci serve e che ti dai. Perdonami per questi giorni. Non ho saputo come fare"

Vivo per lei e non è un peso. Vivo per lei anch'io lo sai. E tu non esserne geloso. Lei è di tutti quelli che. Hanno un bisogno sempre acceso. Come uno stereo in camera. Di chi è da solo e adesso sa. Che è anche per lui, per questo. Io vivo per lei. È una musa che ci invita. A sfiorarla con le dita. Attraverso un pianoforte. La morte è lontana. Io vivo per lei. Vivo per lei che spesso sa. Essere dolce e sensuale. A volte picchia in testa ma. È un pugno che non fa mai male. Vivo per lei, lo so mi fa. Girare di città in città. Soffrire un po', ma almeno io vivo. È un dolore quando parte. (Vivo per lei dentro gli hotels). Con piacere estremo cresce. (Vivo per lei nel vortice). Attraverso la mia voce. Si espande e amore produce. Vivo per lei, nient'altro ho. E quanti altri incontrerò. Che come me hanno scritto in viso. Io vivo per lei. Io vivo per lei. Sopra un palco o contro un muro. (Vivo per lei al limite). ...Anche in un domani duro. (Vivo per lei al margine). Ogni giorno. Una conquista. La protagonista. Sarà sempre lei. Vivo per lei perchè oramai. Io non ho altra via d'uscita. Perchè la musica, lo sai. Davvero non l'ho mai tradita. Vivo per lei perchè mi dà. Pause e note in libertà. Ci fosse un'altra vita la vivo. La vivo per lei. Vivo per lei la musica. Io vivo per lei. Vivo per lei è unica. Io vivo per lei. Io vivo per lei. Io vivo. Per lei"

Se ti batte nella testa un'emozione.. L'orgoglio che ti piglia,. Le notti in cui il rimorso ti sveglia. Per la paura di sbagliare,. Ma se ti ritroverai. Senza stelle da seguire.

Ed è cosi che va la vita e il suo percorso. in equilibrio tra il rimpianto ed il rimorso. e restiamo a curare i nostri pezzi di cuore. che siamo il sangue che scorre e che inventa l'amore. il passato è passato e non c'è niente da fare. lo puoi perdere o lo puoi cercare. in queste notti cosi vuote. e nella camera 200 note

Que se prueban la chaqueta de papá,. Pero luego que deprisa crecerá su vida. Como un río desbordado y hablarán de amor en una esquina. ¿Por qué no volverán?. Esa libertad,. Y esas carcajadas de los pocos años. ¿Por qué no volverán?. No sé donde están. No sé donde están. Dos hermanas que conspiran como dos buenas amigas,. Son dos almas que jamás dividirán la realidad,. Que una nocha con la luna, que mala fortuna. Se sentían dos sirenas en el viento gritaban su pena. ¿Por qué no volverán?. La complicidad,. Y las confesiones de contarse todo. ¿Por qué no volverán?. No sé donde están. El recuerdo no consuela cuando trato de volver a verlas. ¿Por qué no volverán?. Las canciones que. En la ducha yo cantaba a voz en grito. ¿Por qué no volverán?. La felicidad. No sé donde está"

Cuántas dudas, cuántos porqués,. si no es amor que es lo que puede ser,. irresistiblemente suya me, quedo con él.. Al menos dime que me adorarás,. dámelo todo, abrázame al final,. y júrame después que no me dejarás.. ¿Qué puede pasar?. podrías lastimarme tú. pero puedes resultar herido,. oh no, tu no. ¿Por qué no...?. diré que ha sido culpa mía,. diré que han sido mis manías,. que lo he querido y lo he buscado yo.. ¿Por qué no...?. esta noche te diviertes tú,. mañana la venganza es mía,. porque mañana puede ser mi día.. ¿Por qué no?"

Falto de ilusiones y piedad. Y ¿quién nos salvará?. Sueños vendados por la realidad,. Que quedan dentro sin salir,. En esta meta infinita que está. Donde nadie pudo ir,. Y nunca irá. ¿Qué historia es, qué historia es?. Grito de rabia y pregunto por qué,. Nunca termina todo el dolor que se ve. ¿Qué historia es?. Mas la respuesta no sé. Todo es una incógnita,. No queda dignidad,. El mal es cosa lógica. Por su normalidad. Es como las promesas que. Mañana ya ninguno mantendrá,. Mas ¿quien se salvará?. Trenes nocturnos en la oscuridad. Mas dime luego dónde vas. Lunas de plata que alguno quemó,. Con ponerlas en el sol,. Yo digo no. ¿Qué historia es, qué historia es?. Grito de rabia y pregunto por qué,. Nunca termina todo este odio que ves. Conseguiré. Que con mi voz tú me escuches tal vez. En los confines,. Donde el dolor nunca esté,. Donde el dolor nunca esté. ¿Qué historia, qué historia es?. Alguien podrá responder. En los confines,. Donde el dolor nunca esté,. En los confines. Donde el dolor nunca esté"

Si me dejas que te embarque. Por las olas de un inmenso mar. Contra aquellos que nos juzgan. Sin palabras ni la música. Alzando nuestros brazos hasta el cielo. Como símbolo de libertad. El derecho de soñar para la humanidad. Sintiendo en nuestra cara un viento nuevo. Una nueva posibilidad. La exigencia de encontrar una revancha más que grita ya. Abrázala para encontrar la alternativa sola y única. Abrázala, es libertad. Toda la esencia y la genialidad alzándonos. Abrázala, es libertad. Toda la esencia y la genialidad.

Te interrogan y nunca te dejan ver. Si serán amor o placer. Y cúantas noches lloraré por él. Cúantas veces volveré a leer. Aquellas cartas que yo recibía. Cuando mis penas eran alegrías. Son amores esporádicos. Pero en ti quedarán. Amores, tan extraños que vienen y se van. Que en tu corazón sobrevivirán. Son historias que siempre contarás. Sin saber si son de verdad. Son amores frágiles. Prisioneros, cómplices. Son amores problemáticos. Como tú, como yo. Son amores, frágiles. Prisioneros, cómplices. Tan extraños que viven negándose. Escondiéndose de los dos.

Che divida con te i tuoi guai.. Mai! tu non mollare mai!. Rimani come sei,. Insegui il tuo destino,. Perché tutto il dolore che hai dentro. Non potrà mai cancellare il tuo cammino. E allora scoprirai. Che la storia di ogni nostro minuto. Appartiene soltanto a noi.. Ma se ancora resterai,. Persa senza una ragione. In un mare di perché. Dentro te ascolta il tuo cuore. E nel silenzio troverai le parole.. Chiudi gli occhi e poi tu lasciati andare,. Prova a arrivare dentro il pianeta del cuore. È difficile capire. Qual è la cosa giusta da fare. Se ti batte nella testa un'emozione.. L'orgoglio che ti piglia,. Le notti in cui il rimorso ti sveglia. Per la paura di sbagliare,. Ma se ti ritroverai. Senza stelle da seguire. Tu non rinunciare mai. Credi in te! Ascolta il tuo cuore!. Fai quel che dice anche se fa soffrire.. Chiudi gli occhi e poi tu lasciati andare,. Prova a volare oltre questo dolore.. Non ti ingannerai. Se ascolti il tuo cuore,. Apri le braccia quasi fino a toccare. Ogni mano, ogni speranza,. Ogni sogno che vuoi. Perché poi ti porterà fino al cuore. di ognuno di noi.. Ogni volta, che non sai cosa fare,. Prova a volare, dentro il pianeta del cuore.. Tu tu prova a volare. Do do do dov'è il pianeta del cuore.. Tu tu tu dentro il pianeta del cuore."

Su blancura en mi interior y te amaré,. Como en los cuentos de hadas. Pasa siempre.. Te esperaré en compañía. De un millón de golondrinas por el aire,. En la tierra mía.. Descubrirás,. Que envejece y te acaricia con su baile,. Ahora amanece y el alba traerá. Cálidas luces y esperanzas.. Celeste. Y el cielo así, celeste. celeste.. Tendrás libros, juegos y zapatos. Tus brillantes amarcord.. Será tan negro como el mío tu cabello. Un instante y ya verás, tú volarás,. A una isla muy lejana de la ciudad.. Como yo lo hice también cariño mío,. Porque el sol puede olvidarse de la luna.. Te esperaré, sin escapar,. A mi regazo llegarás entre algodones.. Te escucharé, te quedarás. Mientras que las hojas cambian sus colores.. A mi ventana el otoño llegó. Un dulce aroma de castañas se funde. En un cielo así, celeste.. Un soplido de la vida, que abre todas las persianas. Y que a sonreír te invita aunque ya no quieras más.. Este viento enamorado tú también respirarás.. Tú respirarás.. Pues me sobra el coraje de esperarte un poco más. A tu llegada miraremos hacia el este. Y el cielo será, celeste. celeste.. El cielo será, celeste"

O tiene amor escondido. Ay ay ay ay amor. Eres la rosa que me da calor. Eres el sueño de mi soledad. Un letargo de azul un eclipse de mar. Pero ay ay ay ay amor. Yo soy satélite y tu eres mi sol. Un universo de agua mineral. Un espacio de luz que solo llenas tu ay amor. Te regalo mis manos. Mis parpados caídos. El beso mas profundo. El que se ahoga en un gemido. Te regalo un otoño. Un día entre abril y junio. Un rayo de ilusiones. Un corazón al desnudo. Ay ay ay ay amor. Eres la rosa que me da calor. Eres el sueño de mi soledad. Un letargo de azul un eclipse de mar. Vida ay ay ay ay amor. Yo soy satélite y tu eres mi sol. Un universo de agua mineral. Un espacio de luz que solo llenas tu ay amor
2,laura-pausini,Baci Che Si Rubano,Partire quando dorme ancora la città. Nell'aria fresca con la macchina che va. Chissà se ci sarà quest'anno. Quel ragazzo in discoteca al molo. Come pirati che si appostano nei bar. Ragazzi mettono il tuo cuore in trappola. C'è musica che va nel buio. Chiudi gli occhi e cadi dentro a un guaio. Baci che si rubano. E la pioggia su di noi. In questo mare dire. Amore è una bugia. Che vola via innocente. Voci che si giurano. Di non lasciarsi mai. Su quelle spiagge. Giorno e notte più affolate che in città. Il sole con gli occhiali scuri se ne andrà. È il gioco antico degli sguardi inizierà. Le compagnie che fanno tardi. La mattina in spiaggia siamo zombi. Quanti tramonti che non scorderemo mai. Quanti maglioni messi sulle spalle e poi. Quelle carezze sulla sabbia. Sono un faro accesso nella nebbia. Baci che si rubano. E la pioggia su di noi. In questo mare amaro. Amore di un addio. Che fugge via per sempre. Voci che si giurano. Di non lasciarsi mai. Ma già le spiagge sono vuote. E questa estate se ne va. Ora che la vita è stretta. Da questa realtà. Per tutto un anno il cuore aspetta solo. Quella libertà. Baci che si rubano. E la pioggia su di noi. In questo mare dire. Amore è una bugia. Che vola via innocente. Voci che si giurano. Di non lasciarsi mai. Ma già le spiagge sono vuote. E questa estate se ne va. Baci che si rubano. E la pioggia su di noi. In questo mare amaro. Amore di un addio. Che fugge via per sempre. Voci che si giurano. Di non lasciarsi mai. Ma già le spiagge sono vuote. E questa estate se ne va

Se podía hablar jugando a quitarnos la ropa. Convertimos las peleas en paces. El primero que se rinde y lo dice, ya sabe. ¿cómo pudimos llegar a querernos tan mal? de verdad no lo sé. ¿cómo has podido decirme que aquí cada uno sabrá lo que hacer?. Un paseo por el centro y sentarnos en un banco. Bastaba. Hacer caso a tus consejos aunque estés equivocado. Bastaba. Y romper con nuestras buenas maneras. Con las que disimulamos errores y quejas. Sumergirnos bajo el agua helada. Y aceptar que ya sabemos que es agua pasada. Cómo pudimos llegar a querernos tan mal, de verdad no lo sé. Cómo has podido decirme que aquí cada uno sabrá lo que hacer. Cómo caímos tan bajo tú y yo. Cómo pudimos echarnos en cara que el odio nos vence a los dos. Bastaba. Darnos todo aunque sea poco, o que entiendes tú por poco. Bastaba. Y tragarnos las palabras en las calles de ginebra. Bastaba. Esta noche abre los ojos y nos mira. Viendo las caricias pobres en guerra. Esta noche abre los ojos y nos mira. Viendo lágrimas de plata cayendo en la tierra. ¿cómo pudimos llegar a querernos tan mal? de verdad no lo sé. ¿cómo has podido decirme que aquí cada uno sabrá lo que hacer?. (bastaba).

Come ci siamo permessi di dirci che ognuno fa quello che può. Una camminata in centro in un pomeriggio bianco. Bastava. Prevedere il tuo fastidio, fare i conti sopra l'odio. Bastava. Fare a meno delle buone maniere. Che confondono e rubano spazio e spessore. E buttarci sotto l'acqua gelata. E accettare che davvero è acqua passata.

Sempre più sull'acceleratore. Del mio cuore che sta. Già perdendoti ma non ce la fa. A capire come ritornare a vivere. E un'altra settimana se ne va. Senza sapere che sarà di noi. Dimmi perché siamo qui a lottare. Io contro te fino a stare male. Fino a quando non sarà finita. E non c'è mai un attimo di pace. Nessuno che parli sottovoce. Abbiamo perso il senso della vita. Certo che se ti guardi intorno. Tu lo vedi da te. Quanta rabbia c'è che poi entra in noi. E ci mette contro non importa mai il perché. Quante volte ho detto vado via. Da una vita che non sento mia. Dimmi perché siamo tutti matti. Anche io e te come cani e gatti. E ci lasciamo sempre una ferita. La gente è sempre più cattiva. Un mare che sbatte sulla riva. Abbiamo perso il gusto della vita. Ma stasera vengo in pace e io spero che ci sia. Un minuto per parlare fuori dalla follia. Siamo così, siamo tutti matti. Anche io e te come cani e gatti. Ma se c'è un amore non è mai finita. E ci sarà sempre ancora un modo. Anche per noi per slacciare il nodo. E ritrovare il gusto della vita"

Sulla scia di un'altra età ballando sogna. Mentre la tenera luce dell'est. All'alba illumina speranze e ginestre. E il cielo è così. Celeste.... Celeste.... Avrai libri, sandali e secchielli. Luminosi amarcord. Saranno neri come i miei i tuoi capelli. Ma in un attimo lo so. Volerai via. Verso l'isola lontana. Di una città. Come ho fatto un giorno anch'io. Amore mio. Perché il sole può scordarsi della luna.... Ti aspetterò. E prima o poi. Arriverai senza nemmeno far rumore. Ti sentirò. E resterai. Mentre ormai le foglie cambiano colore. Al mio paese che ancora non sai. Dove l'autunno odora di caldarroste. E il cielo è così... celeste!. Come il soffio della vita. Che spalanca anche le imposte. E a sorridere ti invita. Anche quando non lo vuoi. Questo vento innamorato. Che anche tu respirerai. Che respirerai. E poi avrò il coraggio di aspettarti ancora un po'. E ti prometto che vedrai dalle finestre.

Hago todo y mas que todo. He tratado de escapar,. He probado a despreciarte. Traicionarte hacerme daño. Porque en tu mar voy naufragando. Y yo no se... no se. Si conviene estar nadando. O es mejor dejarse ir al fondo. Cariño mio que puedo hacer. No me resigno a estar asi. Por eso yo que te amo. Vivo implorando. Ayudame y te destruire. Si un dia quieres tu volver de nuevo.

2,laura-pausini,Cinque Giorni,Cinque giorni che ti ho perso. Quanto freddo in questa vita. Ma tu. Non mi hai cercato più. Troppa gente che mi chiede. Scava dentro la ferita. E in me. Non cicatrizzi mai. Faccio male anche a un amico. Che ogni sera è qui. Gli ho giurato di ascoltarlo. Ma tradisco lui e me. Perché quando tu sei ferito non sai mai. Oh mai. Se conviene più guarire. O affondare giù. Per sempre. Amore mio come farò a rassegnarmi a vivere. E proprio io che ti amo ti sto implorando. Aiutami a distruggerti. Cinque giorni che ti ho perso. Mille lacrime cadute. Ed io. Inchiodato a te. Tutto e ancora più di tutto. Per cercare di scappare. Ho provato a disprezzarti. A tradirti a farmi male. Perché quando tu stai annegando non sai mai. Oh mai. Se conviene farsi forza. O lasciarsi andare giù. Nel mare. Amore mio come farò a rassegnarmi a vivere. E proprio io che ti amo ti sto implorando. Aiutami a distruggerti. Se un giorno tornerò nei tuoi pensieri. Mi dici tu chi ti perdonerà. Di esserti dimenticata ieri. Quando bastava stringersi di più. Parlare un po'. E proprio io che ti amo ti sto implorando. Aiutami a distruggerti.

Soli non si vive mai. Mi salverò. Perché questa vita cambia e cambierò. Per un bacio che ho cercato fino a ieri, fino a qui. Puoi morire e poi rinascere così. Quanta carezza c'è. Nella malinconia la mia. E il dolore prima o poi se ne va via. Come un vortice che mi trascina. E mi riporta su. Ancora viva. Ah! Come una danza ormai. La vita avanza e poi. Rinasce insieme a noi. E va come un oceano che. Trasporta via con sè. Tutti gli errori miei. Senza rimpianti ormai. Ah! Come una danza ormai. Soli non si piange mai. La vita avanza in noi. E non ci lascia mai. E va cerca speranza ormai. Come una danza e poi. Torna negli occhi miei. Perché da soli sai. Qui non si piange mai. La vita cambia e cambierò. Come una danza la vivrò. Con la speranza che ora ho.

Soledad nunca estás sola, soledad. Aunque hay días que ella siente que lo está. Soledad está cansada de sentirse separada y sin amor. Como tú y como yo. Trabajando para poder descansar. Una guerra diaria para estar en paz. Posponiendo lo que sueña con tener. Un niño lo aprendió que no puede ser. Busca crecer. Y no sabe qué es lo que tiene que hacer. Soledad nunca estás sola, soledad. Aunque hay días que ella siente que lo está. Soledad está cansada de sentirse separada y sin amor. Como tú y como yo. Busca busca soledad. Busca busca la verdad.

Ah, como una danza va. La vida avanza y ya lejos nos llevará. Y va, como un océano que. Baila diciéndome cuanto me equivoqué. Porque yo sola aquí. Ya no sabré vivir. (sola ya no sé vivir). Me salvaré, porque si esta vida cambia, yo también. Por un beso que he buscado, que hasta ayer no pudo ser. Es morirse o puedes renacer así. Cuántas caricias hay, cuánta melancolía. (la mía). El dolor tarde o temprano se termina. Como un vértigo que me domina. Y que me hará sentir ahora viva. Ah, como una danza va. La vida avanza y ya lejos nos llevará. Y va, como un océano que baila diciéndome. Que ahogaría en él cuanto me equivoqué. Ah, como una danza va. La vida avanza y ya nunca nos dejará. Y va, busca esperanzas, va. Como una danza y ya mis ojos brillarán. Porque yo sola ya, no volveré a llorar. Como una danza. La vida cambia y cambiaré. Como una danza viviré. Con la esperanza que busqué.

E un pane da dividere. Avvicinati anche tu. E permettimi di più. la tua bocca sulla mia per non andare via. E balliamo a piedi nudi con la musica alla radio. Più forte mentre gli anni passano. In questa casa che profuma in ogni angolo. Faremo il nostro simbolo.. Avremo anche noi colori che forse non sapremo evitare. Nemmeno affrontare ma niente di noi perduto andrà. Semplicemente vincendo l'incuria del tempo. Danzando in due a passo lento. Con sentimento come adesso qua.. Lo sguardo resterà. Senza alcuna impurità. In richezza o povertà. Non si consumerà. E balliamo a piedi nudi con la musica alla radio. Più forte mentre gli anni passano. In questa casa che io amo in ogni angolo. E dove mi medessimo.. Tu fallo con me.

Más fuerte mientras años pasarán. En esta casa que respira en cada angulo.. Hagamos de esto un simbolo. Tendremos tambien dolores a veces,. Sin saber evitarlos peor afrontarlos, que importa. Se solucionaran, sencillamente venciendo. La incuria del tiempo danzando tu y yo a paso lento. Con sentimiento como siento ya. Tu mirada brillara, con total impùnidad.

2,laura-pausini,Così Importante,Giorno dopo giorno. Sento il tempo che mi sfugge fra le mani ed io. Lì a rincorrere. I miei pensieri i desideri. Di questi anni a volte amari e senza regole. Li ricorderai. Come se fosse stato solo un sogno. Vivere soltanto di quegli attimi. E non cercarti piu´. Ma non è così importante. Solo un attimo di forte nostalgia. Scivolando negli sguardi fra la gente. Io cammino indifferente per la via. Colpa di un´estate. Dei profumi di una notte di un momento che. Non dimentico. Guidati dalla voglia di sentirsi. All´improvviso sempre piu´ vicini. Così vicini che. Adesso è troppo tardi per pensare. Di dimenticarti e poi rinascere. E non cercarti più. Ma non so cos´è importante. Se fidarmi o non fidarmi di te. Di quel viso così impresso nella mente. Non saprei ma ci penso sempre sai. E non c´è niente. Che cancelli il ricordo di te. Di uno sguardo malinconico e sognante. Dove sei dimmi adesso dove sei. In un attimo ritorno al mio presente. E vorrei che tu fossi ancora qui. Tu che sei così importante. Puoi sentire il mio bisogno di te. Nei tuoi occhi vedo acqua trasparente. Come un fiume travolgente dentro me

2,laura-pausini,Dare To Live (vivere) (Part. Andrea Bocelli),"Try looking at tomorrow not yesterday. And all the things you left behind. All those tender words you did not say. The gentle touch you couldn't find. In these days of nameless faces. There is no one truth but only pieces. My life is all i have to give. Dare to live until the very last. Dare to live forget about the past. Dare to live giving something of yourself to others. Even when it seems there's nothing more left to give. Ma se tu vedessi l'uomo. Davanti al tuo portone. Che dorme avvolto in un cartone. Se tu ascoltassi il mondo una mattina. Senza il rumore della pioggia. Tu che puoi creare con la tua voce. Tu, pensi i pensieri della gente. Poi, di Dio c'e solo Dio. Vivere, nessuno mai ce l'ha insegnato. Vivere, non si può vivere senza passato. Vivere è bello anche se non l'hai chiesto mai. Una canzone ci sarà, qualcuno che la canterà. Dare to live searching for the ones you love. (Perché, perché, perché, perché non vivi questa sera?). Dare to live no one but we all. (Perché, perché, perché, perché non vivi ora?). Dare to live until the very last. (Perché, perché, perché la vita non è vita). Your life is all you have to give (Perché). non l'hai vissuta. Vivere!. Dare to live until the very last. (Perché, perché, perché Ia vita non è vita). Your life is all you have to give (Perché). non l'hai vissuta mai. I will say no (I will say yes). Say dare to live. Dare to live"

Ma più mi guardo in giro e vedo che,. C'è un mondo che va avanti anche se. Se tu non ci sei più. Se tu non ci sei più. E dimmi perché. In questo girotondo d' anime. Non c'è un posto. Per scrollarsi via di dosso. Quello che ci è stato detto. E quello che ormai si sa. E allora sai che c'è. C'è che c'è, c'è che prendo un treno. Che va a paradiso città. E vi saluto a tutti e salto su. Prendo il treno e non ci penso più. Un viaggio ha senso solo senza ritorno. Se non in volo. Senza fermate nè confini. Solo orizzonti neanche troppo lontani. Io mi prenderò il mio posto. E tu seduta lì al mio fianco. Mi dirai destinazione paradiso. Paradiso città."

Cuenta si amas y el porqué. Cuenta a quién amas y el porqué. Mírame. Si no te oigo, escúchame. Si no hay palabras, quédate. Si el bien lo malgastamos pero aún existe. Discúlpame. Si no te he entendido, ayúdame. Si después me pierdo, abrázame. Veo aún entrar la luz por esas dos ventanas. Con mis intentos frágiles. Lucho contra el pánico la ausencia insuperable. No sabes que difícil es. Perderse entre los bordes de una cama donde no te encuentro más. Más. Mírame. Si yo me distraigo, escúchame. Y con el silencio, quédate. Esta noche es complicada pero es solo nuestra. Y discúlpame. Si yo no te entiendo, ayúdame. Frente a ti espero, abrázame. Veo aún entrar la luz por esas dos ventanas. Y mírame.

Recitando i gesti e le parole che ho perso. E ritorno da te dal silenzio che è in me. Tu dimmi se c'é ancora per me. Un'altra occasione, un'altra emozione. Se ancora sei tu, ancora di più. Un'altra canzone, fresca e nuova. Tu dimmi se ormai qualcosa di noi. C'è ancora dentro gli occhi tuoi. Oh no, gli occhi tuoi. E ritorno da te perché ancora ti voglio. E ritorno da te contro il vento che c'è. Io ritorno perché ho bisogno di te. Di respirare fuori da questa inquetudine. Di ritrovare mani forti su di me. E non sentirmi sempre così fragile. Tu dimmi solo se c'è ancora per me. Un'altra occasione, un'altra emozione. Dimmi se ancora sei tu, ancora di più. La nostra canzone che risuona. Tu dimmi se ormai qualcosa di noi. C'è ancora dentro gli occhi tuoi, oh no. Se ancora sei tu. Una canzone fresca e nuova. Tu dimmi se ormai qualcosa di noi. C'è ancora dentro gli occhi tuoi. Oh no, gli occhi tuoi. Dimmi solo se c'è. E ritorno da te"

En compañia.. Hablale de ti. Sin temor al que decir. Dirle aquello que. Ha nascido en ti. Y será un amor cómo queiráis vosotros dos. Havrá palabras siempre bellas. Días llenos de emociones nuevas. Ojos de mirada enamorada que dará. Envídia al sol de vuestras tardes sin edad. Pero escuchame. Que fácil és hacerse daño. Aúnque, no quiera nadie. Cuando el amor está empezando. Oh... No. Él no está por ti. Buena amiga tímida. Él no está por ti. El amor nasciendo sí!"

Si una puerta se te cierra, otra puerta se abrirá. Lo que en realidad importa es no renunciar jamás,. Pues tal vez estés a un solo paso.... Busca una salida, un mañana que. Dé una nueva vida a todo el mundo que. Luchará con fe, con ese valor que no se ve. Por todos ellos, échale valor,. Por quien lo pierde y lo va buscando,. Por los que se sienten tan mal como tú,. Por esos que esperan sin desesperar, como tú. Busca una salida, un mañana que. Dé una nueva vida a todo el mundo que. Sólo por dolor no se pierda en el camino.

Yo estoy aquí y quiero hablarte ahora, ahora. Porque se rompen en mis dientes. Las cosas importantes. Esas palabras que nunca escucharás. Y las sumerjo en un lamento. Hacie. Haciéndolas salir, son todas para ti. Una por una aquí. Las sientes ya. Pesan y se posaran entre nosotros dos. Si me faltas tú, no las puedo repetir. No las puedo pronunciar. En cambio no me llueven los recuerdos. De aquellos días que corríamos al viento. Quiero soñar que puedo hablarte ahora, ahora. En cambio no, hoy no hay tiempo de explicarte.

En la puerta de al lado. Me sorprendo incluso a mi. Y si me contento es sólo por azar. A escondidas miro hacia ti. El trébol de tu boca lo quiero para mi. Te he buscado en todas partes. Y estabas aquí. Dime a donde vas. Así de encantador. Que me disfrazarás. La realidad de fábulas. Un cómplice ideal. Y no lo sabes ya. Que un día me querrás. Me esperarás. Sé que estarás. En la puerta de al lado. En la puerta de al lado, uuh. Y tu único defecto. Es no despertarte junto a mi. Dime a dónde vas. Así de encantador. Que me seducirás. Con la pasión y pétalos de rosas.

Alegrias de otros que veras. Y este tiempo inconciliable que. Juega ya contra ti. Acabamos al final de pie. En una ventana para ver. Espectadores melancolicos. De felicidad improbable. Tantos viajes que quisiste hacer. Y ahora sabes que no puede ser. Un dolor que tu conoces bien. Solo el no te abandonara ya jamas. Te refugias en tu soledad. Mientras crece tu fragilidad. Los milagros ya no esperaras. Ahora ya no. Con muñecos ya no hables mas. Y no toques esas pildoras. Esa monja es tan simpatica. Con las almas tiene practica. Te daria mi mirada. Para hacerte ver lo que quieras. La energia la alegria. Para regalarte sonrisas. Di que si siempre si. Y podras volar con mis alas. Donde tu sabes ya. Con tu corazon y sin penas. Hacer brillar de nuevo el sol. Para que el invierno se vaya. Curarte las heridas y. Darte dientes para que comas. Y luego verte sonreir. Luego verte correr de nuevo. Olvida ya. Hay quien se olvidara. De llevar una flor. Pasar un sabado. Despues silencios. Despues silencios... Silencios. En los jardines donde nadie va. Se respira la inutilidad. Hay respeto y limpieza pura. Es casi locura. Es tan bello abrazarte aqui. Defenderte y luchar por ti. Y vestirte y peinarte asi. Y susurrarte: no te rindas no. En los jardines donde nadie va. Cuanta vida cuanta soledad. Los achaques crecen dia a dia. Somos nadie sin la fantasia. Sostenles tu abrazales. Te ruego no dejemos que caigan. Esiles, fragiles tu cariño. Nunca les niegues. Estrellas que ahora no se ven. Pero dan sentido a este cielo. Los hombres no pueden brillar. Si no brillan tambien por ellos. Manos que ahora temblaran. Porque el viento sopla mas fuerte. No les dejes ahora no. Que no les sorprenda la muerte. Somos egoistas cuando en vez. De ayudar nos negamos. Olvida ya. Hay quien se olvidara. De llevar una flor. Pasar un sabado. Despues silencios. Despues silencios... Silencios"

Tu, que por dentro me conoces,. Ya sabrás que vivo el momento. Más difícil de llevar.. ¿no fué bastante haberme equivocado?. No me ha servido haber pagado deudas. Si me quedan, ahora,. Mis maneras de sentir. Aún tan frágiles.. Y sueño con saber si existes. O, si estos son juegos inútiles.. ¿dónde estarás?, ¿dónde, alma mía?. Que, yo sin tí, me perderé.. ¿dónde estarás?, ¿dónde, alma bella?. ¿dónde estarás?.... Mi corazón se eleva en sus latidos;. Tiempo de amor y yo te estoy buscando. Y, mis ojos, me hacen daño. De tanto mirar.. ¿dónde estarás?, ¿dónde, alma mía?. Que, yo sin tí, me perderé.. ¿dónde estarás?, ¿dónde, alma bella?. Estrella gemela...¿dónde estarás?. Tal vez, detrás de la luna estarás,. Como el sueño más difícil de hallar.. ¿no comprendes que yo vivo por tí?. ¿dónde estarás?"
2,laura-pausini,Every Little Thing You do,When you listen to my heart. Oh I like it. When you touch me. I get so excited. And I never thought that I would say. I'm upon away and so into. Every little thing you do. When you look at me that way. Oh it moves me. When you take my hand the love goes right through me. And the reason that it feels so good. Is because you put your heart into. Every little thing you do. You're the rhythm in my song. You're the switch that turns me on. The only place where I belong or want to be. You're the half that makes me whole. The only one who seizes my soul. Baby it's so real but still I can't believe. Every little thing that you do to me. When you take my hands. I like it. Oh I Like it. When you listen to my heart. Oh I like it. I like it. Even in the night when you're not here with me. My sweetest dreams still take me to. Every little thing you do. You're the rhythm in my song. You're the switch that turns me on. The only place where I belong and or want to be. You're the heaven that makes me hope. The only one who seizes my soul. Baby it's so real but still I can't believe. You're the rhythm in my song. You're the switch that turns me on. The only place where I belong and want to be with you. You're the heaven that makes me hope. The only one who seizes my soul. Baby it's so real but still I can't believe. Every little thing you do to me. I Like it. I like it. Every little thing. I like it.
2,laura-pausini,Everyday Is A Monday,"Feels like I´ve been frozen in time. And I´m looking for an easy way. To get on with my life. But I know, you´re the one to tell. I´ve been putting on a masquerade. I ain´t doing that well. Everything has crashed. And I´m losing this game. Can´t help myself but wonder. Do you feel the same?. How could I ever say goodbye. Everyday is a Monday. Without you by my side. I must have been a fool to try. Everyday is a Monday. Without you in my life. Tell me, it´s a big mistake. ´Cause I kinda I learned my lesson. More than I can take. Freedom, had a price to pay. I don´t want to be the one. To throw it all away. Everything has crashed. And I´m losing this game. Can´t help myself but wonder. Do you feel the same?. (Chorus). We were the weekend always living to be free. Now I´m stuck here on Monday, when I need you every day of the week. Everything has crashed. And I´m losing this game. Can´t help myself but wonder. Do you feel the same?. (Chorus)"

E del coraggio che appartiene. Achi non è andato via, mai via. Crediamo ancora nei detagli. Le cose semplice e i risvegli. Che cambiano il mondo, in ogni secondo. Noi siamo qui per ascoltarci. E siamo fatti per amarci. Come vuoi tu, come sei tu. Fai quello che sei. Fallo con orgoglio. E dove stai andando arriverai. Così ti voglio. Fai quello che sei. Quando fa più male.

Così funido per conigli e colibri Il vento gl'insegnò i sapori di. di resina e di miele selvatico e pioggia lo bagnò. La mia felicità - diceva dentro se stesso -. Ecco... Ecco.... L' ho trovata ora Che. Ora Che sto bene e Che ho tutto Il tempo per me. Non ho più bisogno di nessuno. Quanto smarrimento d'improvviso dentro se. Quello Che solo un uomo senza donna sai Che cos'è. E allungo i suoi rami per toccarla. Capi Che La felicità non è mai La metà di un infinito. Ora era insieme luna e sole, sasso e nuvola. Era insieme riso e pianto o soltanto era un uomo Che cominciava a vivere. Ora era Il canto Che riempiva La sua grande immensa solitudine,. Era quella parte vera Che ogni favola d'amore racchiude in se per poterci. Credere (5x)"

De plomo se volvió. Cuando dijiste lo siento. Pero ya no bastó. Saliste por la puerta grande. De lejos te vi yo. He creído en mi. En mis ojos negros. Como algunas noches. Cuando tus respiros derriban el cielo. Y no sientes dolor. Cae sobre mí. Esta lluvia fina. Que despinta el aire. Y lo vuelve puro. He mentido a todos. Y he creído en mi. Quería sólo dar en el blanco. De un corazón que perdió su centro. Cuando quise decir todo. Mi voz me traicionó. Y la sangre en mis venas. De plomo se volvió. Miraste hacia el pasado. Y ya no estaba yo. Saliste por la puerta grande. El dolor te olvidaste. Y lo he vencido yo

Heal the world. Make it a better place. For you and for me. And the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living. Make it a better place. For you and for me. If you want to know why. There's love that cannot lie. Love is strong. It only cares of joyful giving. If we try we shall see. In this bliss we cannot feel. Fear od dread. We stop existing and start living. The it feels that always. Love's enough for us growing. So make a better world. Make a better place. Heal the world. Make it a better place. For you and for me. And the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living. Make a better place for you and for me. And the dream we were conceived in. Will reveal a joyful face. And the world we once believed in. Will shine again in grace. Then why do we keep strangling life. Wound this earth, crucify its soul. Though it's plain to see. This world is heavenly. Be god's glow. We could fly so high. Let our spirits never die. In my heart I feel you are all my brothers. Create a world with no fear. Together we cry happy tears. See the nations turn their swords into plowshares. We could really get there. If you cared enough for the living. Make a little space. To make a better place. Heal the world. Make it a better place.

Comes with no demands and no strings. If in your eyes I see for sure. That you're the one I'm waiting for. I'll give my heart, my soul, my everything. If I have to let go out my dreams. Because someone I never never thought I'd be. If that's love I want, I want no part. But if you're gonna be that kind of man. Who's waiting just to take me as I am. If that's love then you've got my heart. Tell me in your arms I'll be safe, baby tell me. Loneliness I'm fear in all place. The only thing you have to do. The only thing I ask could be you. Is give your heart, your soul and your faith. And if you can't give those things to me. Then hard I just have to tell you honestly. If that's love I want no part. But if you say you finally found in me. The only place that you could ever be. If that's love you've got my heart. If that's love baby you've got my heart. If that's love. If that's love.

E quando sbagli non importa ci riproverai. Ci sarà sempre una porta un ostacolo per noi. Quel che conta veramente è non rinunciare mai. Perché forse c'è soltando a un passo. Una via d'uscita, un domani che. Porti un'altra vita per tutti anche per te. Se ci crederai, troverai il coraggio che non c'è. Per tutti quelli che non l'hanno più. Per chi l'ha perso e lo sta cercando. E per chi sta male come stavi tu. Ma che ancora spera fino a che poi ci sarà. (coro). Una via d'uscita un domani che. Porti un'altra vita per tutti anche per te. Una strada che non si perda nel dolore. (coro). Non lasciati andare cerca dentro te. Quella via d'uscita, il domani che. Tu ritroverai dentro quel coraggio che ora c'è"

Quello che non puoi concedermi. Dimmi cose da non crederci. Portami fuori di me dentro di noi. Tu non sai cosa può fare una donna innamorata. Una donna innamorata della vita come me. Tu non sai cosa può fare una donna innamorata. Una donna innamorata della vita come me. Tutto quello che io voglio vivere. È quello che potevo vivere con te. Tutto quello che io voglio essere. È quello che potevo essere con te

2,laura-pausini,Invece No,Forse bastava respirare. Solo respirare un pò. Fino a riprendersi a ogni battito. E non cercare l'attimo. Per andar via. Non andare via. Perchè non può essere abitudine. Diciembre senza te. Chi resta qui. Spera l'impossibile. Invece no. Non c'è più tempo per spiegare. Per chiedere se ti avevo datto amore. Io sono qui. E avrei da dire ancora. Ancora. Perchè si spezzano tra i denti. Le cose più importanti. Quelle parole che non osiamo mai. E faccio un tuffo nel dolore. Per farle rissalire riportarle qui. Una per una qui. Le senti tu. Pesano e si posano. Per sempre su di noi. E si manchi tu. Io non sò riperterle. E non riesco a dirle più. Invece no. Qui piovono i ricordi. Ed io farei di più. Di ammettere che è tardi. Come vorrei poter parlare. Ancora ancora. Invece no non ho. più tempo per spiegare. E avevo anch'io. Io qualcosa da sperare. Davanti a me. Qualcosa da finire insieme a te. Forse mi basta respirare. Solo respirare un pò. Forse è tardi. Forse invece no

L'impronta di una testa sul cuscino. I passi lenti e incerti di un bambino. Lo sguardo di serenità. La mano che si tenderà. La gioia di chi aspetterà. Per questo e quello che verrà. Io canto. Le mani in tasca canto. La voce in festa canto. La banda in testa canto. Corro nel vento e canto. La vita intera canto. La primavera canto. La mia preghiera canto. Per chi mi ascolterà. Voglio cantare. sempre cantare. L'odore del caffè nella cucina. La casa tutta piena di mattina. E l'ascensore che non va. L'amore per la mia città. La gente che sorriderà lungo la strada. I rami che si intrecciano nel cielo. Un vecchio che cammina tutto solo. L'estate che poi passerà. Il grano che maturerà. La mano che lo coglierà. Per questo e quello che verrà. Io canto. Le mani in tasca canto. La voce in festa canto. La banda in testa canto. Corro nel vento e canto. La vita intera canto. La primavera canto. L' ultima sera canto. Per chi mi ascolterà. Voglio cantare. sempre cantare. cantare. (canto). Le mani in tasca... canto. La voce in festa canto. La vita intera... canto. Corro nel vento e canto. Io canto. La vita intera canto. Io canto!.

2,laura-pausini,It's Beginning To Look a Lot Like Christmas,It's beginning to look a lot like christmas. Everywhere you go. Take a look in the five-and-ten. Glistening once again. With candy canes and silver lanes aglow. It's beginning to look a lot like christmas. Toys in every store. But the prettiest sight to see. Is the holly that will be. On your own front door. A pair of hopalong boots. And a pistol that shoots. Is the wish of barney and ben. Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk. Is the hope of janice and jen. And mom and dad can hardly wait. For school to start again. It's beginning to look a lot like christmas. Everywhere you go. There's a tree in the grand hotel. One in the park as well. The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow. It's beginning to look a lot like christmas. Soon the bells will start. And the thing that will make them. Ring is the carol that you sing. Right within your heart. It's beginning to look a lot like christmas. Toys in every store. But the prettiest sight to see. Is the holly that will be. On your own front door. So it's christmas once more

Well someday love is going to lead you back to me. But till it does I'll have an empty heart. So I'll just have to believe. Somewhere out there you're thinking of me. Till the day I'll let you go. Till we say our next hello its not goodbye. Till I see you again. I'll be right here remembering when. And if time is on our side. There will be no tears to cry on down the road. There is one thing I can't deny. It's not goodbye. You think I'd be strong enough to make it trough. And rise above when the rain falls down. But it's so hard to be strong. When you've been missing somebody so long. Its just a matter of time I'm sure. But time takes time and I can't hold on. So wont you try as hard as you can. Put my broken heart together again?. Till the day I'll let you go. Untill we say our next hello it's not goodbye. Till I see you again. I'll be right here remembering when. And if time is on our side. There will be no tears to cry on down the road. There is one thing I can't deny. It's not goodbye. EEhh. It's not goodbye. Till the day I'll let you go. Untill we say our next hello its not goodbye.

Tu poesía me pidió volver. Marcharme ha sido toda una experiencia. Y ya lo sé. Yo jamás dejé de quererte a ti. Yo jamás pude negarmi a ti. Jamás abandoné. He buscado la belleza. Y la he encontrado al fondo en la simplicidad. He buscado en mi pasado porque ahí dijeron que está la verdad. Se que en esencia predomina el bien. Y en él confío como los demás. Y esta noche ahora te diré. Que jamás te dejé de pensar. Té daré más de lo que hay que dar. Yo ahora se. Sin duda cuanta fantasía. Demanda el alejarse. Sólo vuelves si te vas un día. De nuevo yo (de nuevo yo). De nuevo tú (de nuevo tú). Siempre evitándonos a oscuras. Y al final se ve la luz. Se ve la luz. Yo jamás dejé de quererte a ti. Yo jamás pude negarmi a ti. Jamás abandoné. Ves, yo soy así. Me has dicho vuelve. Y ya estaba aquí"

Porque he aprendido a hacerme compañía. Dentro de mí. Engañare a la melancolía. Bella como nunca yo me vi jamás. Codo a codo a mi destino. Escrito por las líneas de la mano. El tornado que me tira a un lado. Soy tan solo yo. Tengo la esperanza de que al fin pasó. El defecto es la experiencia que aun no hay ahora. Pero ya no me disgusta. Eso no me asusta. Soy yo. Vuelvo a ser yo. Porque he aprendido a hacerme compañía. Dentro de mí. Repito una blasfemia, una poesía. Bella como nunca lé escuche jamás, jamás.

Your Spanish lullaby"

Ora so. Che la mia risposta sei tu. Perchè. Vivo di te. Ora so. Che c'è una risposta per me. Per me. Sei tu. ed ho amato senza mai decidere. con un cuore nomade. ogni fuoco ritornava cenere. le mie impronte segni sulla polvere. ho abitato la noia buttando via. il mio tempo che non torna più. barricandomi di solitudine. ho pregato che arrivassi tu. Immaginando un'altra vita insieme a te. di giorni facili. e giorni un po' più facili. più semplici. e quante volte nello specchio ho chiesto a me. l'amore quello vero poi cos'è. Ora so. Che la mia rispposta ssei tu. Perchè. Vivo di te. Non sarò mai più la stessa perchè. Tu sei. Più forrte di me. Ora so. E questo mi basta di te. Non ho. Dubbi per me. Come un cerchio che una fine non ha mai. come l'alba che ritorna sempre sai. ritorna sempre sai. il tempo del mio tempo adesso sei. ed ogni cosa ha un senso intorno a noi. e non ritorneranno mai. Dubbi per me. Ora so che la mia risposta sei tu. Perchè. Tu sei come me. Ora so. Che un'altra risposta non c'è. Perchè io vivo di te. Vivo di te.

E anche se questo sai. Non è quello che vuoi. Non sei più che un dettaglio ormai. Perché mi affascina l´autonomia, la prospettiva che ieri non era mia. Anche se a volte il bisogno c´è, non manca niente di te,. di te, di te, perché. Oggi tu sei per me. polvere. ferma nei corridoi. pagine. di ricordi e di noi. Ora anch´io. Sento che. Sono più stabile.

Su banco está vacio, Marco sigue en mí. Le siento respirar pienso que sigue aquí. Ni la distancia enorme puede dividir. Dos corazones y un solo latir. Quizas si tú piensas en mí. Si a nadie tú quieres hablar. Si tú te escondes como yo. Si huyes de todo y si te vas. Pronto a la cama sin cenar. Si aprietas fuerte contra ti. La almohada y te echas a llorar. Si tú no sabes cuanto mal. Te hará la soledad.... Miro en mi diario tu fotografía. Con ojos de un muchacho un poco tímido. La aprieto contra el pecho y me parece que. Estás aquí entre inglés y matemáticas. Tu padre y sus consejos, que monotonía. Por causa del trabajo y otras tonterías. Te ha llevado lejos sin contar contigo. Y ha dicho un día lo comprenderás. Quizas si tú piensas en mí. Con los amigos deverás. Tratando sólo de olvidar. No es nada facil la verdad. En clases ya no puedo más. Y por las tardes es peor. No tengo ganas de estudiar. Por ti mi pensamiento va. Es imposible dividir así. La vida de los dos. Por eso espérame, cariño mío. Conserva la ilusión. La soledad entre los dos. Este silencio en mi interior. Esta inquietud a ver pasar así. La vida sin tu amor. Por eso espérame porque. Esto no puede suceder. Es imposible separar así. La historia de los dos. La soledad entre los dos.

A scuola il banco è vuoto, marco è dentro me. è dolce il suo respiro fra i pensiere miei. Distanze enormi sembrano dividerci. Ma il cuore batte forte dentro me. Chissà se tu mi penserai. Se con i tuoi non parli mai. Se ti nascondi come me. Sfuggi gli sguardi e te ne stai. Rinchiuso in camera e non vuoi mangiare. Stringi forte a te il cuscino. Piangi e non lo sai quanto altro male ti farà la solitudine. Marco nel mio diario ho una fotografia. Hai gli occhi di bambino un poco timido. La stringo forte al cuore e sento che ci sei. Fra i compiti d'inglese e matematica. Tuo padre e i suoi consigli che monotonia. Lui con il suo lavoro ti ha portato via. Di certo il tuo parere non l'ha chiesto mai. Ha detto un giorno tu mi capirai. Chissà se tu mi penserai. Se con gli amici parlerai. Per non soffrire più per me. Ma non è facile lo sai. A scuola non ne posso più. E i pomeriggi senza te. Studiare è inutile tutte le idee si affollano su te. Non è possibile dividere la vita di noi due. Ti prego aspettami amore mio.... Ma illuderti non so!. La solitudine fra noi. Questo silenzio dentro me. e l'inquietudine di vivere la vita senza te. Ti prego aspettami perché. Non posso stare senza te. Non è possibile dividere la storia di noi due. La solitudine fra noi.

Le mani sul cuscino. I tuoi occhi su di me. Li ho cercati da lontano. Quando ho capito che di me. Hai visto l'invisibile. Guardami. Se non ti sento, ascoltami. Se sto in silenzio, resta qui. Se tutto il bene che ti ho dato ancora esiste. Scusami. Se non ti ho capito, aiutami. Sono qui per questo, abbracciami. Perché vedo ancora luce in quelle due finestre. Due finestre. Ho avuto tanto e di più. Ma tra le cose che ho. Non ho trovato rifugio. Non l'ho trovato però. Si dice che il destino. Perdona solo se. Al di là di ciò che abbiamo. Conta se ami ed il perché. Conta chi ami ed il perché. Guardami. Se non ti sento, ascoltami. Se sto in silenzio, resta qui. Se tutto il bene consumato ancora esiste. Scusami. Se non ti ho capito, aiutami. E se poi mi perdo, abbracciami. Perché vedo ancora luce in quelle due finestre. Ma sono così fragile. Sento in mezzo al panico. L'assenza che mi assale. Non sai quanto è difficile. Perdersi tra immagine di un letto. Dove non ti trovo mai. Mai. Guardami. Se non sto a sentire, ascoltami. Finché c'è silenzio, resta qui. È una notte complicata ma soltanto nostra. E scusami. Se non ti capisco, aiutami. Sono qui per questo, abbracciami. Perché vedo ancora luce in quelle due finestre. E guardami. Se amore è sempre amore in fondo poi resiste. Guardami. E se ti cerco, ascoltami. Sono qui per questo, abbracciami. Tutto il bene che hai provato. Ancora esiste"

2,laura-pausini,Lettera,Volevo dirti quello che. Non son riuscita a dire mai. Ed ho tenuto chiuso in me. Da troppo tempo ormai. Ma c'è un amore che non so. Più nascondere perché. Adesso ha bisogno anche di te. Volevo dirti solo che. Sei sempre tu la mia allegria. Che quando parli insieme a lei. Diventa folle gelosia. Per tutto quello che mi dai. Anche quando non lo sai. Questo io volevo dire a te. Di come quando non ci sei. Io mi perdo sempre un po'. E poi mi accorgo che non so. Più divertirmi senza te. Invece quando stai con me. Anche il grigio intorno a noi. Si colora della vita che gli dai. Com'è difficile. Dire tutto questo a te. Che d'amore non parli mai. Non ne parli mai con me. Forse perché. Hai paura come me. Di una risposta che. Ancora tu non sai qual è. Volevo dirti quello che. Non son riuscita a dire mai. Ed ho tenuto chiuso in me. Da troppo tempo ormai. Ma c'è un amore che non so. Più nascondere perché. Adesso ha bisogno anche di te

Muchos le seguirán. Porque hicimos lo justo. Sí, lo hemos hecho juntos. Y aunque a veces fue duro. Del miedo yo no huyo. Protégeme entre tus brazos. Atrapa mi risa en tus manos. Y dame aquellos consejos. Que harán de mi tu reflejo. Como cuando era una niña. Y en tu cama me dormía. Esperando las historias. Que de noche me contabas. Al llegar. Como cuando era una niña.

Mientras con mi muñeca vieja te escuchaba. los cuentos que tú cada noche me contabas. y cuando más pequeña tú me acurrucabas. y adormecida en tu regazo yo soñaba..

Y me pasaba el día sin volver a casa,. no soportaba tus sermones para nada,. y comencé a volverme yo también celosa,. porque eras casi inalcanzable, tan hermosa.. Y abandoné mi sueño a falta de equipaje,. mi corazón al mar tiré en una vasija,. perdí hasta la memoria por falta de coraje,. porque me avergonzaba tanto ser tu hija.. No, no, no, no, no.. Mas no llamaste tú a mi puerta,. inútilmente tuve un sueño que no. puede realizarse,. mi pensamiento está tan lleno del presente. que mi orgullo no me deja perdonarme.. Mas si llamases a mi puerta en otro sueño,. no lograría pronunciar una palabra,. me mirarías con tu gesto tan severo. y yo me sentiría cada vez mas sola.. Por eso estoy en esta carta tan confusa,. para econtrar algo de paz en lo que pienso,. no para reclamarte ni pedirte excusas,. es solo para decirte, mama...¡lo siento!..

Si tu no sabes cuanto mal. Te hará la soledad.... Nanaira... Nanaira.... Nanaira.... Miro en mi diario tu fotografía. Con ojos de muchacho un poco tímido. La aprieto contra el pecho y me parece que. Estás aquí entre inglés y matemáticas. Tu padre y sus consejos que monotonía. Por causa del trabajo y otras tonterías. Te ha llevado lejos sin contar contigo. Te ha dicho un día lo comprenderás. Quizás.... Si tu piensas en mi. Con los amigos deberás. Tratando sólo de olvidar. No es nada fácil la verdad. En clase ya no puedo más. Y por las tardes es peor. No tengo ganas de estudiar. Por ti mi pensamiento va. Es imposible dividir asi. La vida de los dos. Por eso esperame, cariño mio. Conserva la ilusión. La soledad entre los dos. Este silencio en mi interior.

2,laura-pausini,Me Quedo,Me quedo mucho más de lo que pierdo. Te dejo ir a ti y no al recuerdo. Me quedo aquellos años del encanto. Los otros llegaran y te los cuento. Porque los dos supimos ser felices. y superar nuestros obstáculos. Mirar contigo siempre hacia delante. era ya solo un espectáculo. Y comprendí que duerme mucho. menos quien ama un poco más. Me quedo los escalofríos dorados. Porque olvidarlos no seria sensato. Me quedo incluso esta herida abierta. Y el no tener razón no me atormenta. Porque hay que aceptar las diferencias. que hubieron siempre entre tú y yo. Vivir sin insistir en la importancia de ser frágil o ser vencedor. Y mientras tú dormías yo espiaba al cielo. Vi las estrellas bailando de puntillas mirándote a ti. Hasta colmar tus espacios de la luz más hermosa de allí. Hasta inundar nuestra vida de la luz más hermosa. Me quedo las cosas que has dicho en la puerta. Tu aliento en el pecho y las flores de malva. Porque no hay ningún fallo y un final y en medio el bien se quedara. Me quedo tu rencor si te parece. Te juro que el mio lo deje perderse. Si hemos sido parte de un error. A veces fuimos también algo mejor

En este universo que no para de mentir. cruza una nube que pinta el cielo de gris. confío tan solo en ti, porque contigo soy feliz.. Y sé que caminarás en mis silencios tú. y que me llenarás com tus alas de luz.. Me fido de ti aunque yo nunca te lo dije aún, no lo sabes tú. Me siento tan bien, aí, cuánto tú. tocas mi corazón, mi mente, solo tú. cuando dices te quiero tanto. más, más. que no puede saberse cuánto.. Más, más.. Me siento tan bien, así, cuando tú rozaz mi boca ducelmente, sí, sólo tù. y me dices que no es amor, que es más… más aún.. En este tiempo que no sabe consolar. cuanta es la fuerza que com la tuya me das, me fido de ti y de las promesas que me harás.. No sé como sucedió, mas tuvo que ocurrir. hasta me iría yo al inferno por ti.. Qué pena porque ti quiero tanto y no lo sabes tú, no lo sabes tú.. Me siento tan bien, así, cuando tú. tocas mi corazón, mi mente, solo tú. cuando dices no hay que enfadarse. más, más. cuando ríes sin preocuparte.. Más, más.. Me diento tan bien, así, cuando tú, gridas mi nombre entre la gente con inquietud. y me dices que vamos juntos. que mis venas corres tú.. Me siento tan bien.. Siempre así. así, cuando tú. siempre así. tocas, mi corazón mi mente. oh, yeah... Sólo tú. Cuando dices te quiero tanto. más, más. que no puede saberse cuanto.. Más, más.

2,laura-pausini,Medley: La Isla Bonita / Y Mi Banda Toca El Rock,"Last night I dreamt of San Pedro. Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song. A young girl with eyes like the desert. It all seems like yesterday, not far away. Tropical the island breeze. All of nature wild and free. This is where I long to be. La Isla Bonita. And when the samba played. The sun would set so high. Ring through my ears and sting my eyes. Your Spanish lullaby. Y mi banda toca el rock. Y lo demas cuando lo piden. Sabemos bien que aqui. Hacer de todo lo exigen. Y es un rock bambino. Un sabor mas bien latino. Esta musica es esperanza. Esta musica es pasion. Si es como un tren que ha pasado. Con un cargo de emociones. Nos pasó en la estación. Pero dormíamos sentados. Y mi banda toca el rock. Por que nos ve y porque no puede. Y porque falta reir. Por correr tras su quimera. Y no despierten no, no, no, todavia no. Y no nos paren no, no, no, todavia no. Y mi banda toca el rock. Y cambia cada cuando lo piden. Desde que entras el mismo. Casi siempre lo exigen. Lo esperan en la colina. Con la musica latina. Nos veran tambien bailando. Y mil vueltas van buscando. Nos espera en la frontera. Con el auto bloqueado. Mas el rock habra pasado. Y la musica ha llegado. Es un rock, bambino. Un sabor mas bien latino. Y asi su pasaporte. Lo seguimos corriendo fuerte. Que penetra en los muros. Hace brecha en la puerta. Hasta el fondo el te dice. Que tu alma no esta muerta. Y no despierten no, no, no, todavia no. Y no nos paren no, no, no, todavia no. Y mi banda toca el rock. Es una eterna salida. Llega bien en ondas medias. Y en frecuencia modulada. Es un rock san siro. Un sabor mas bien latino. Esta musica es esperanza. Esta musica es pasion. Si es como un tren que ha pasado. Con un cargo de emociones. Nos paso en la estacion. Pero dormíamos sentados. Y mi banda toca el rock. Por que nos ve y porque no puede. Y porque falta reir. Por correr tras su quimera. Y no despierten no, no, no, todavia no. Y no nos paren no, no, no, todavia no. Y no despierten no, no, no, todavia no. Y no nos paren no, no, no, todavia no. Tropical the island breeze. All of nature wild and free. Ah ah ah ah ah ah. And when the samba played. The sun would set so high. Ah ah ah ah ah ah. Todavia no. Todavia no. Todavia no. Todavia no. Todavia no"

Cuánta gente me decía. no confíes nunca en él. con la envidia del que espera. problemas entrever. Menos mal, me alegro, todo a cambiado. Menos mal , el fallo,. es el no haberte encontrado tiempo atrás. Lo que antes, que la inmotividad. forjas en mi forma de ser. es injusto a quien juzgues. la elegido entre las dos. tras el vidrio susurrante. ya no es la misma no. Menos mal, me alegro, todo a cambiado. Menos mal, por eso. lo malo a pasado todo es así...ligero. si tú estás aquí. a regalarme días únicos.

È un' anquila nel cielo e va. che vola sul presente e va. e scioglie tutto il gelo e va. sognando immensamente. l 'anima che balla libera il pensiero. seguirà una stella che dai buio nascerà. e sarà una danza magica davvero. mi darà speranza mentre avanza. questa notte va.... Quanto è grande il cielo dell'' america. è un mare capovolto. avrai letto certo la mia lettera. è stato un grande salto. via da tutto per un'avventura. del futuro io non ho paura. e non sono in cerca di vendette. ti perdono mentre la notte va. È come un uragano e va. trascina la mia mente e va. portandomi lontano e va. sgnando immendamente. L'anima che balla libera il pensiero. seguirà una stella che dal buio nascerà. e sarà una danza magica davvero. mi darà speranza mentre questa notte va. È un'aquila nel cielo e va. che vola sul presente e va. e schioglie tutto il gelo e va. sognando immensamente. mentre la notte va...

2,laura-pausini,Mi Dispiace,Mamma ho sognato che bussavi alla mia porta. E un po' smarrita ti toglievi i tuoi occhiali. Ma per vedermi meglio e per la prima volta. Sentivo che sentivi che non siamo uguali. Ed abbracciandomi ti sei meravigliata. Che fossi così triste e non trovassi pace. Da quanto tempo non ti avevo più abbracciata. E in quel silenzio ho detto piano... mi dispiace!. Però è bastato quel rumore per svegliarmi. Per farmi piangere e per farmi ritornare. Alla mia infanzia a tutti quei perduti giorni. Dove d'estate il cielo diventava mare. Ed io con le mie vecchie bambole ascoltavo. Le fiabe che tu raccontavi a bassa voce. E quando tra le tue braccia io mi addormentavo. Senza sapere ancora di essere felice.. Ma a sedici anni io però sono cambiata. E com'ero veramente adesso mi vedevo. E mi senti ad un tratto sola e disperata. Perché non ero più la figlia che volevo. Ed è finita li la nostra confidenza. Quel piccolo parlare che era un grande aiuto. Io mi nascosi in una gelida impazienza. E tu avrai rimpianto il figlio che non hai avuto.. Ormai passavo tutto il tempo fuori casa. Non sopportavo le tue prediche per nulla. E incominciai a diventare anche gelosa. Perché eri grande irraggiungibile e più bella. Mi regalai così ad un sogno di passaggio. Buttai il mio cuore in mare dentro una bottiglia. E persi la memoria mancando di coraggio. Perché mi vergognavo di essere tua figlia!. Ma tu non bussi alla mia porta e inutilmente. Ho fatto un sogno che non posso realizzare. Perché ho il pensiero troppo pieno del mio niente. Perché l'orgoglio non mi vuole perdonare. Poi se bussassi alla mia porta per davvero. Non riuscirei nemmeno a dirti una parola. Mi parleresti col tuo sguardo un po' severo. Ed io mi sentirei un'altra volta sola.. Perciò ti ho scritto questa lettera confusa. Per ritrovare almeno in me un po' di pace. E non per chiederti tardivamente scusa. Ma per riuscire a dirti mamma... mi dispiace!. Non è più vero che di te io mi vergogno. E la mia anima lo sento ti assomiglia. Aspetterò pazientemente un altro sogno.. Ti voglio bene mamma... scrivimi... tua figlia

2,laura-pausini,Mi Perspectiva,"He cambiado mis números. He cambiado de amigos y de hábitos. Para huir de una vida que. Yo contigo atisbé.. Como luz tras los árboles. Como flor en un día que va a nevar. Salvaré los obstáculos. Con instantes de serenidad.. Eres tú para mí. Polvo que. Se quedó en un rincón,. Cajas de nuestra vida en común. Y aunque sé que jamás. Lo querrás admitir. No eres más que un detalle ya.. Porque me entusiasma la autonomía. La perspectiva que ayer no era toda mía. Y aunque el deseo me hierve, sí. Nada echo en falta de ti, de ti. De ti, porque .... Eres hoy para mí. Polvo que. Se quedó en un rincón. Cómplice de un recuerdo o de dos. Ahora yo siento que. Más estable seré. Es el punto de renacer.. Es partir desde aquí. Confusa pero feliz. Libre de todo y de ti. Mi perspectiva es así. Así, así.. No será nunca más. Cosa de ti y de mí. No eres más que un detalle ya.. Porque me entusiasma la autonomía. Mi perspectiva es así."
2,laura-pausini,Mi Respuesta,"El destino no existía para mí,. Hasta que me lo has cambiado tú,. En mi barco navegaba en libertad,. Con la vela de mi alma y nada más.. En mis días no encontraba lógica,. Cada noche era una duda más,. Me sentía como flor de plástico. Olvidada en un rincón inhóspito.. Y yo balaba en equilibrio hasta saber. Lo frágil que al caer se puede ser,. Frente al espejo cuántas veces pregunté. Si llegará el amor a mí también.. Ahora se que mi respuesta eres tú,. Porque vivo de tí.. Ahora se que ya mi respuesta encontré,. amor, si... tú.. He querido sin lograrme decidir,. -Corazón de nómada-. Cada fuego era una llama efímera. Y mi huella una señal milésima.. He vivido en el seno de la apatía,. Y mi tiempo guardo en un baúl,. Mi trinchera fué mi triste soledad. He rogado que llegaras tú.. Imaginándome otra vida junto a tí,. De hermosos días fáciles. Y cuántas veces al espejo pregunté. En donde está el amor que yo soñé.. Ahora se que mi respuesta eres tú,. Porque vivo de tí.. No seré nunca la misma porque. Tendré tu amor para mí.. Me llegó, con esto me basta, saber. Que yo no dudo de tí.. Como un círculo que el agua abriendo va,. Como ele alba que comienza a despertar,. La tierra de mi mundo tengo en tí,. Las cosas tienen ya sentido así.. Las dudas a mí,. Ahora se que mi respuesta eres tú,. Porque tú vives en mí.. Ahora se que no hay más respuesta, que no,. Porque yo vivo de tí, vivo de tí."

Disfo le valigie e chiamo le mie amiche e poi. ho ancora da studiare ed io che cerco te in quelle pagine. Da domani tutto come sempre tornerà. La gente il traffico in città. Non voglio amare più così. Come vorrei odiarti farti anche del mare, ma. vorrei soltanto averti qui con me non voglio amare più così. Io senza te che vita è. Ogni sera esco e tu sei li che guardi me. Da quella foto al mare ed io ti chiuderei in una scatola. Mi ha telefonato quella che non amolla mai. ma se l'amassi forse io potrei con lei dimenticare te. Poi delle vacanze quanto se ne parlerà. Storie leggere dell'età non voglio amare più così. Voglio anche scherzare non drammatizzare ma. più parlo e più ti vedo qui con me non voglio amare più così. Io senza te che vita è. Non voglio amare più così."

Perchè con te ho imparato che felici lo si è senza un miracolo. Con te guardare dalla stessa parte .. era già quello uno spettacolo. E poi ho capito che dorme di meno chi ama un po' di più. Mi tengo certi brividi alla schiena ... Perchè fermarli non ne val la pena. Mi tengo pure una ferita aperta. Di aver ragione .. cosa me ne importa?. Perchè non c'è una colpa da cercare .. se non c'è nessun colpevole!. C'è solo un'altra strada da trovare. Non c'è il forte .. non il debole. Ma mentre tu dormivi .. io spiavo il cielo:. Vedevo stelle alzarsi sulle punte e buttarle su te. Fino a riempire la stanza della luce più bella che c'è. Fino a riempire la vita della luce più bella. Mi tengo le cose che hai detto alla porta ... La fitta sul petto e i fiori di carta. Perchè non c'è una colpa .. c'è una fine. E in mezzo il bene che rimane. Mi tengo la tua rabbia .. se ti pare. La mia, ti giuro, l'ho lasciata andare!. Se siamo stati parte di uno sbaglio ... A volte anche qualcosa di un po' meglio"

Que cómplice de nuestra precauciones. Con su verdad tajante. Nos dividió así en dos direcciones. Perdona se hace algunos días. No he sabido contestarte. Tenía una escapatoria nueva. Y ganas de encontrarme. Y nadie ha dicho que me faltes siempre. A veces nieva improvisadamente. Y algunos ángulos del cielo no verán la luz jamás. Nadie ha dicho que sea indiferente. A la mirada que te vuelve ausente. Y al egoísmo de un recuerdo al que no puedo renunciar. Búscate un amigo. Que sea el refugio bajo la tormenta. Si lo que yo te debo. Es ser honesta, el resto ya no cuenta. Perdona se hace algunos días. No he sabido contestarte. El tren que lleva al aeropuerto. Me verá alejarte. Y nadie ha dicho que me faltes siempre. A veces nieva improvisadamente. Y algunos ángulos del cielo no verán la luz jamás. Nadie ha dicho que sea indiferente. A la mirada que te vuelve ausente. Y al egoísmo de un recuerdo al que no puedo renunciar. (Y nadie ha dicho) Y nadie ha dicho. (Y nadie ha dicho) Y nadie ha dicho. ¿Y quién te ha dicho que sea indiferente?. Lo que tuvimos fue tan importante. Nos quedaremos con lo bueno. Y será nuestra libertad. Perdona si te he confundido. También yo quiero renacer"
2,laura-pausini,Nei Giardini Che Nessuno Sa,"Senti quella pelle ruvida.. Un gran freddo dentro l'anima,. Fa fatica anche una lacrima a scendere giù.. Troppe attese dietro l'angolo,. Gioie che non ti appartengono.. Questo tempo inconciliabile gioca contro di te.. Ecco come si finisce poi,. Inchiodati a una finestra noi,. Spettatori malinconici,. Di felicità impossibili.... Tanti viaggi rimandati e già,. Valigie vuote da un'eternità.... Quel dolore che non sai cos'è,. Solo lui non ti abbandonerà mai, oh mai!. E' un rifugio quel malessere,. Troppa fretta in quel tuo crescere.. Non si fanno più miracoli,. Adesso non più.. Non dar retta a quelle bambole.. Non toccare quelle pillole.. Quella suora ha un bel carattere,. Ci sa fare con le anime.. Ti darei gli occhi miei,. Per vedere ciò che non vedi.. L'energia, l'allegria,. Per strapparti ancora sorrisi.. Dirti si, sempre si,. E riuscire a farti volare,. Dove vuoi, dove sai,. Senza più quei pesi sul cuore.. Nasconderti le nuvole,. Quell'inverno che ti fa male.. Curarti le ferite e poi,. Qualche dente in più per mangiare.. E poi vederti ridere,. E poi vederti correre ancora.. Dimentica, c'è chi dimentica. Distrattamente un fiore una domenica. E poi... silenzi. e poi silenzi.. Nei giardini che nessuno sa. Si respira l'inutilità.. C'è rispetto grande pulizia,. È quasi follia.. Non sai come è bello stringerti,. Ritrovarsi qui a difenderti,. E vestirti e pettinarti si.. E sussurrarti non arrenderti. Nei giardini che nessuno sa,. Quanta vita si trascina qua,. Solo acciacchi, piccole anemie.. Siamo niente senza fantasie.. Sorreggili, aiutali,. Ti prego non lasciarli cadere.. Esili, fragili,. Non negargli un po' del tuo amore.. Stelle che ora tacciono,. Ma daranno un segno a quel cielo.. Gli uomini non brillano. Se non sono stelle anche loro.. E Mani che ora tremano,. Perché il vento soffia più forte.... Non lasciarli adesso no.. Che non li sorprenda la morte.. Siamo noi gli inabili,. Che pure avendo a volte non diamo.. Dimentica, c'è chi dimentica,. Distrattamente un fiore una domenica. E poi silenzi. e poi silenzi"
2,laura-pausini,Nel Blu Dipinto Di Blu (feat. Eros Ramazotti),"Penso che un sogno così non ritorni mai più. Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu. Poi d'improviso venivo dal vento rapito. E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito. Volare, oh, oh!. Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!. Nel blu, dipinto di blu. Felice di stare lassù. E volavo volavo felice più in alto del sole ed ancora più su. Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva lontano laggiù. Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me. Volare, oh, oh!. Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!. Nel blu, dipinto di blu. Felice di stare lassù. Ma tutti sogni nell'alba svaniscon perché. Quando tramonta, la luna li porta con sé. Ma io continuo a sognare negli occhi tuoi belli. Che sono blu come un cielo trapunto di stelle. Volare, oh, oh!. Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!. Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu. Felice di stare quaggiù. E continuo a volare felice più in alto del sole ed ancora più su. Mentre il mondo pian piano scompare negli occhi tuoi blu. La tua voce è una musica dolce che suona per me. Volare, oh, oh!. Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!. Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu. Felice di stare quaggiù. Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu. Felice di stare quaggiù. Con te!"

Mi presento a ti. Perche so che non giudicherai. Da subito. Mi fiderò. E semplice è chiaro già. Nel primo sguardo c’è una verità. Dal primo sguardo sento se varrà la pena. Subito se merità. Non voglio più defendermi. Nel primo sguardo c’è una verità. Dal primo sguardo so che lo farò. Mi fiderò. Subito. So scegliere per me. E amare quel che ho. Capire se c’è un rischio. Tanto poi io rischierò. Tu sai sono così. L'istinto mio è così. Da subito.... Nel primo sguardo c’è una verità. Dal primo sguardo sento se varrà la pena. Subito e semplice. Aspetto un pò.

Promise me to be. The promise that I need. [Verse 2]. All of the wings. That I thought were bonded. That threw away. My whole damn world. Finally fly me. And finally save me.

Lasciando il vuoto in questa vita mia. Senza risposte ai miei perché. Adesso cosa mi resta di te?. Non c'è... non c'è il profumo della tua pelle. Non c'è... il respiro di te sul viso. Non c'è... la tua bocca di fragola. Non c'è... il dolce miele dei tuoi capelli. Non c'è... che il veleno di te sul cuore. Non c'è... via d'uscita per questo amore. Non c'è... non c'è vita per me, più. Non c'è... non c'è altra ragione che mi liberi l'anima. Incatenata a notti di follia. Anche in prigione me ne andrei per te. Solo una vita non basta per me. E anche l'estate ha le sue nuvole. E tu sei l'uragano contro me. Strappando i sogni nei giorni miei te ne sei andato di fretta perché. Non c'è... non c'è che il veleno di te sul cuore. Non c'è... via d'uscita per questo amore. Non c'è... non c'è vita per me più. Non c'è... non c'è altra ragione per me. Se esiste un Dio no può scordarsi di me anche se. Fra lui e me c'è un cielo nero nero senza fine. Lo pregherò, lo cercherò e lo giuro ti troverò. Dovessi entrare in altre dieci cento mille vite. In questa vita buia senza di te sento che. Ormai per me sei diventato l'unica ragione. Se c'è un confine nell'amore giuro lo passerò. E nell'imenso vuoto di quei giorni senza fine ti amerò. Come la prima volta a casa tua. Ogni tuo gesto mi portava via. Sentivo perdermi dentro di te. Non c'è... non c'è il profumo della tua pelle. Non c'è... il respiro di te sul viso. Non c'è... la tua bocca di fragola. Non c'è... il dolce miele dei tuoi capelli. Non c'è... non c'è il veleno di te nel cuore. Non c'è... non c'è via d'uscita per questo amore. Non c'è... non c'è vita per me più.

Le rogaré, le buscaré, lo juro, le encontraré. Aunque tuviera que buscar en un millón de estrellas. En esta vida obscura, absurda sin él. Siento que.

La colpa non esiste. Ma ognuno prenda la sua direzione. Perdonami per questi giorni. Non li ho saputi raccontare. Avevo un indirizzo nuovo. E un posto per scappare. E non è detto che mi manchi sempre. Le cose cambiano improvvisamente. E certi angoli di notte non avranno luce mai. E non è detto che non provo niente. Se tengo gli occhi sul tuo sguardo assente. E se mi fido della forza di un ricordo. Casomai. Prenditi l'ombrello. Che sia il riparo sotto la tempesta. Se quello che ti devo. È avere il cuore dalla parte giusta. Perdonami per questi giorni. Non li ho saputi raccontare. Ho un treno verso l'aeroporto. E un volo tra due ore. E non è detto che mi manchi sempre. Le cose cambiano improvvisamente. E certi angoli di notte non avranno luce mai. E non è detto che non provo niente. Se tengo gli occhi sul tuo sguardo assente. Perché mi fido della forza di un ricordo. Casomai. E non è detto, e non è detto. E non è detto, e non è detto.

Che hanno perso l'amore e restano soli. Grande è il silenzio se si resta soli. La notte è nemica di sogni di ieri. E non è più l'innocenza o l'amore. E nera compagna di pianto e dolore. La notte è triste poesia. Due note alla luna che scivola via. Canzone di poveri cuori. Che hanno perso l'amore e restano soli

Y ahora ya no nos contamos. Alguien se marcha y otros duermen, tú y yo no. . . . . Y desde ese instante mi suerte cambió. Se haya en cualquier sitio nuestro amor de cada día. Me transporta en tu aeroplano a donde nadie iría. Cuando tus gestos son de terciopelo. Cómo mimosas durante febrero. Con tu simplicidad. Discretamente a poco a poco. Crecieron nuestros sentimientos. No necesito un documento para amar. . . Se haya en cualquier sitio nuestro amor de cada día. En las decisiones y caprichos de esta vida. Cuando me abrazas y no me lo espero. Cuando me das mimosas en febrero. Con tu simplicidad. Ésto hoy te doy. Te desvelo cómo soy. Con mis ojos siempre atentos que. Te conquistas con tu amor. Sí, ésto hoy te doy. Con mi empeño y no me voy. Nadie es mejor que tú. Nadie es mejor que tú. Se haya en cualquier sitio nuestro amor de cada día. Si lees el título de esta canción. En cómo te la estoy cantando yo. Y en un obstáculo que encontrarás. Y en la simplicidad. Fueron creciendo poco a poco. Los hijos y los sentimientos. No necesito un documento para amar. Cada día. sí, cada día"
2,laura-pausini,Nuevo,"Me miraste, atrapaste mi corazón. Yo que nunca en mi vida perdí el control. Nos pegamos, bailamos esa canción. En tus manos mi cuerpo se abandonó. Tú y yo conectados. Sin pensarlo todo sucedió. Tú y yo enamorados. Apagamos todo. Alrededor. Eres un hechizo para mí. ¿Cómo fue posible antes de ti. El sobrevivir?. Eres un hechizo y ya lo sé. Lo que espero está por suceder. En tu juego yo me perderé. Es un feeling nuevo. Es un feeling nuevo. Me levanto contigo al amanecer (amanecer). Otra vez quiero hacer lo que hice ayer (que te hice ayer). Lo que siento por ti va creciendo más (va creciendo más). Me pregunto ¿Qué pasa. Porque será? (¿Porque será?). Tú y yo conectados. Sin pensarlo todo sucedió. Tú y yo enamorados. Apagamos todo alrededor. Eres un hechizo para mí. ¿Cómo fue posible antes de ti. El sobrevivir?. Eres un hechizo y ya lo sé. Lo que espero está por suceder. En tu juego yo me perderé. Es un feeling nuevo. Es un feeling nuevo. Es un feeling, es un feeling nuevo. Es un feeling, es un feeling nuevo. Nuevo. Eres un hechizo para mí. ¿Cómo fue posible antes de ti. El sobrevivir?. Eres un hechizo y ya lo sé. Lo que espero está por suceder. En tu juego yo me perderé. Me miraste.

2,laura-pausini,Ogni Colore Al Cielo,per te mi spoglierei. col gesto più segreto. con l'intima certezza. che ora siamo in due. e ti racconterei. di tutto il mio passato. quello dove non hai camminato. quello che un giorno sarai. per te io ruberò. ogni colore al cielo. dipingerò i miei piedi. e ti raggiungerò. per lasciare una traccia e un sentiero. che mi riporti da te. e non avrò paura di volare in alto. e disegnando un arco mi ritroverò. sulle tue ali grandi che mi prenderanno. come si appoggia un fi ore sopra un ramo. come un rumore muore e poi silenzio c'è. io mi trascurerei. se non ti avessi accanto. mi sentirei incompleta. in compagnia di me. sono un libro interrotto e incompiuto. da sempre in attesa di te. e non avrò paura di volarti accanto. e disegnando un arco mi ritroverò. sulle tue mani grandi che mi salveranno. io ti dirò soltanto che ti amo. e tu sarai la cura per rinascere. e non avrò paura di volerti accanto. e con un lungo salto mi ritroverò. sulle tue ali grandi che ci porteranno. fi no a una luce pura da dividere. restituiremo insieme. ogni colore al cielo. al cielo il suo colore. a noi bastiamo noi

2,laura-pausini,One More Time,Nothing I must do. Nowhere I should be. No one in my life. To answer to but me. No more candlelight. No more purple skies. No one to be near. As my heart slowly dies. If I could hold you one more time. like in the days when you were mine. I'd look at you 'till I was blind. So you would stay. I'd say a prayer each time you'd smile. Cradle the moments like a child. I'd stop the world if only I. Could hold you one more time. (hmmmmmm). I've memorized your face. I know your touch by heart. Still lost in your embrace. I'd dream of where you are. (hmmm). If I could hold you one more time. Like in the days when you were mine. I'd look at you 'till I was blind. So you would stay. I'd say a prayer each time you'd smile. Cradle the moments like a child. I'd stop the world if only I. Could hold you one more time. One more time

Mon cœur vide de tout. Ressemble à s'y méprendre. A Paris au mois d'août. De larmes et de rires. Etait fait notre amour. Qui redoutant le pire. Vivait au jour le jour. Chaque rue, chaque pierre. Semblaient n'être qu'à nous. Nous étions seuls sur terre. A Paris au mois d'août. Pour te dire je t'aime. Aussi loin que tu sois. Une part de moi-même. Reste accrochée à toi. Et l'autre solitaire. Recherche de partout. L'aveuglante lumière. De Paris au mois d'août. Dieu fasse que mon rêve. De retrouver un peu. Du mois d'août sur tes lèvres. De Paris dans tes yeux. Prenne forme et relance. Notre amour un peu fou. Pour que tout recommence. A Paris au mois d'août. . . da JP pausini =D"
2,laura-pausini,Parlami,"Parlami, io ti prego non respingermi. Dimmi se, se ti ho perso oppure no. Ho creduto a lui alle labbra sue.. un errore da pagare. Ho creduto che non fossi... Nelle mani, nella mia testa, nei miei muscoli. L´emozione per me più intensa è qui.. con te. Parlami, per favore non escludermi come io ho fatto con te. oh, no, no.. e dimmi se, se è finita oppure c´è, oppure c´è. Nel tuo dolore un raggio di sole, che non scalda ma non muore. Ho bisogno di sentirti qui... Nelle mani, nella mia testa, nei miei muscoli. L´emozione per me più intensa è così. ..io spero che anche tu, che un giorno anche tu la ritroverai... mi troverai, in noi. ..è così, l´emozione per me più immensa è qui. .

2,laura-pausini,Per La Musica,Tendi la mano da un lato. Qualcuno sta lì. Pronto a sentirti già amico. Succede anche così. Noi siamo uguali ma differenti. Un coro di battiti a tempo. Per la musica. E tu che ne hai fatta di strada. Per essere qua. Ogni chilometro ha un? anima. E mille identità. Noi siamo quelli che restano svegli. E ci salviamo in un attimo. Per la musica. E domattina ti svegli. Vicino a chi pare a te. Dove ci hai messo del bene. Non servono regole. Sei nel respiro del vento che muove. Le onde le gambe e lo spirito. Per la musica. Per la musica. Io non mi scordo più. Di queste note infinite e tu. Canta la musica. Con chi ti sta di fianco. Che ti sta di fianco. Perché qui l? hai portato tu. Rendila unica la musica. Elettrica e libera. Niente è uguale niente è differente. Per la musica. È un? anima. È libera è musica. Tendi la mano da un lato. Qualcuno sta lì. Pronto a sentirti già amico. Succede anche così. Per la musica
2,laura-pausini,Per Vivere,Questa strada è la mia casa che non ho. Il soffitto è un grande cielo splendido. Se potessi volerei da un angelo. Per giocare insieme a lui sopra la luna. Questa strada di baracche sbattute la. Dove abita la nostra povertà. è la scuola dei bambini como me. Che hanno per maestre fame e lacrime. Vivere sembra impossibile qui. Come accendere nel mare un falò. è un mondo senza regole. è un brutto film che un giorno scorderò.. Questa strada di tristezza e polvere. Senza mamme di carezze e favole. Ma è qui che vedo il dio della città. Ed è lui che mi dara' la libertà. Vivere è un gioco a perdere qui. è scappare la prigione dei no. è respirare colla per essere. Ladri di attimi `credere. Che ci riesci a vivere. Dentro me cerchero' quella fede che non ho. Dall'amore anch'io così rinascerò. Vivere com'è difficile qui. Quando gridi al cielo kyrie eleison. Ma se vincere un miracolo non si può. So che io non mi arrenderò. Di volermi libero. Vivere forse è possibile qui. Ce l'avrai pietà di noi kyrie eleison. Signore la mia strada io troverò. Con te camminerò. Per vivere per vivere
2,laura-pausini,Perchè Non Torna Più,07 - Perche Non Torna Piu. Sempre giù buttate a terra. Contro i maschi a far la guerra. Quante botte poi la mamma. In camera vi darà. Due bambini stesso sguardo. Pieno di allegria. Che si provano. Le giacche del papà. Poi la vita cresce in fretta. Come un fiume in piena. È le trovi ragazzine. A parlare d'amore in un cortile. Perché non torna più?. Quella libertà. Le risate a scuola fino a stare male. Perché non torna più?. Chi mi a preso voi?. Perchè mi a preso voi?. Stesso cuore stessa pelle. Questo è il patto fra sorelle. Anime che mai potrà. Dividere la realtà. Ma una notte con la luna. Piena di sfortuna. Si sentiva una sirena. Che gridava al vento la sua pena. Perché non torna più?. La complicità. Di quei pomeriggi a raccontarsi tutto. Perché non torna più?. Quella nostra età. Quella nostra età. E il ricordo non consola. Quando cerco di vedermi ancora. Perché non torna più?. La canzone che. Cantavamo nelle docce a squarciagola. Perché non torna più?. La felicità. Della nostra età

Hemos crecido juntos yo y mis ojos como dos amigos. que buscan con el alma un lugar que hoy no existe ya,. entre mil mañanas frescas de bicicletas,. mil atardeceres sobre algún autobús. y con un hambre de sonrisas que regalen luz.. Yo y mis cuadernos de recuerdos, direcciones que he perdido.. He visto caras de quien tanto amé marcharse luego un día. y he respirado un mar desconocido en las horas. silenciosas de un verano de ciudad. mirando mi sombra repleta de melancolía.. Yo con mis noches que he cerrado como cerrando un paraguas. mirándome hacia dentro para leer el dolor y la sal.. He caminado por las calles persiguiendo el viento. y sintiendo un peso de inutilidad. y frágil y violento yo me he dicho tú verás, verás, verás.... Por el camino verás. que no estarás tú solo.. Por el camino encontrarás. un lugar en el cielo.. Oirás por el camino latir tu corazón.. Encontrarás más amor.. Soy sólo gota en este mar de gente que hay en este mundo.. Yo que he soñado sobre un tren que nunca dejó el andén,. Corriendo por los prados blancos de luna. para regalar más tiempo a mi ingenuidad. y joven y violento yo me he dicho tu verás, verás, verás.... Por el camino verás. que no estarás tú solo.. Por el camino encontrarás. también tú un lugar en el cielo.. Oirás por el camino latir tu corazón.. Encontrarás más amor.. Yo sé muy bien que una canción no nos podrá cambiar la vida,. pero no sé muy bien por qué seguimos esta búsqueda infinita,. qué es lo que me mueve dentro a cantar canciones,. a buscar amores una y otra vez. para que sea mejor mañana, porque mañana tú.... Por el camino verás.... Para que sea mejor mañana, porque mañana tú.... Por el camino verás.... Para que sea mejor mañana, porque mañana tú.... Por el camino verás....

2,laura-pausini,Pregúntale Al Cielo,"Si hay un riesgo de hacerse promesas bajo la lluvia. Es que el agua no selle palabras. que al sol le huyan. Aquí el perdón no basta. No es suficiente la capacidad. de dar a tus pies dos alas. Al tiempo nadie le gana en velocidad. Pregúntale al cielo, quizás el nos lo dirá. Si algo sucede sin ser nuestra voluntad.

Sensación de vacío. que avanza con condiciones, que es?. Tu eres lo que me falta. como decirlo se me olvido ya. Tu eres mi puesta en marcha. pero no se adonde me llevarás.

2,laura-pausini,Quello Che Le Donne Non Dicono,"Ci fanno compagnia certe lettera d'amore. Parole che restano con noi. E non andiamo via. Ma nascondiamo del dolore. Che scivola, lo sentiremo poi. Abbiamo troppa fantasia, e se diciamo una bugia. È una mancata verità che prima o poi succederà. Cambia il vento ma noi no. E se ci trasformiamo un po'. È per la voglia di piacere a chi c'è già o potrà arrivare a stare con noi. Siamo così. È difficile spiegare. Certe giornate amare, lascia stare, tanto ci potrai trovare qui. Con le nostre notti bianche. Ma non saremo stanche neanche quando ti diremo ancora un altro si. In fretta vanno via della giornate senza fine. Silenzi che familiarità. E lasciano una scia le frasi da bambine. Che tornano, ma chi le ascolterà. E dalle macchine per noi. I complimenti dei playboy. Ma non li sentiamo più. Se c'è chi non ce li fa più. Cambia il vento ma noi no. E se ci confondiamo un po'. È per la voglia di capire chi non riesce più a parlare. Ancora con noi. Siamo così, dolcemente complicate. Sempre più emozionate, delicate, Ma potrai trovarci ancora quì. Nelle sere tempestose. Portaci delle rose. Nuove cose. E ti diremo ancora un altro si. È difficile spiegare. Certe giornate amare, lascia stare, tanto ci potrai trovare qui. Con le nostre notti bianche. Ma non saremo stanche neanche quando ti diremo ancora un altro si"

Una derrota más.. Si fuera así. Me juego mis temores.. Cuando el mundo te vuelve la espalda. Alza el dedo o le retas de cara. Viva el tormento de quien pregunta. Y la respuesta cuando es la justa.. Cómo podemos hacer para ser felices.. Queda el amor o quien te lo quita. Dejas amigos que se lo hacían. Cómo podemos amar de verdad esta vida.. Quién lo sabrá. Que la verdad. Consiste en no juzgar. Quién lo sabrá. Dentro de ti estará. Quiere salir,. Existe una salida.. Cuando el mundo se encoge de hombros. Tú te indignas o rompes con todo.. Viva el talento de quien pregunta. Y la respuesta cuando es la justa.. Cómo podemos hacer para ser felices. Vuelve a los veinte quien los revive. Fallan las leyes o quien las escribe. Cómo podemos amar de verdad esta vida..

And that it's what you mean to me. It's just that, at night. When I've fallen asleep, you arrive. And I feel that deep within me I hide. The things that you don't know about me. Letting go, no more fighting. Time will show you what you mean to me. Letting go, free my instincts. From the darkness I will re-emerge. Radiant, radiant. And sometimes I'll be incomprehensible. But I won't be how you wanted me to be. I inevitably won't be everything. That you think. When stones rain down and it's not easy. No, to keep on balancing. And buried deep inside. Is all the love that you don't know I hold. Letting go, no more fighting. Time will show you what you mean to me. Letting go, free my instincts. From the darkness I will re-emerge. Radiant, radiant. Oh, oh, oh. Letting go, no more fighting. Time will show you what you mean to me. Letting go, free my instincts. From the darkness I will re-emerge. Radiant. (Radiant). Radiant. Radiant.

Resta un mare che va e ha già spazzato via. La tua,la mia perduta eternità. Che ormai non è che sabbia a raffiche. Ricordami nel freddo di milano. Nei sandali di corse libere. Ricordami se non ti sembra strano rivivere quegli attimi con me. E ritorno naufraga nella stessa camera. E dormo qui senza di te come una stupida. E la vita va testarda più di noi e non ha pietà se adesso non mi vuoi. Ma tu che fai di questa libertà che ormai per me. è un vuoto inutile. Ricordami nel freddo di milano fra I mandorli di un paradiso blu. Ricordami non senti che ti chiamo non chiedermi di non amarti più. E mi sveglio naufraga nella stessa camera. E scappo via lasciando qui quest'alba splendida. Ricordami. Ricordami ricorda da lontano ricorda chi non vuole perderti. Mentre il tempo corre via flash di una fotografia. Ho un regalo se mi vuoi la vita che verrà per noi"

Quedan solo nubes por amor. y se dispersarán. se irán llorando, mudas, tristes. y de espaldas a la escena. como cuando el tiempo pasa. y ya no nos espera más. ya no nos espera más. Dices que un sueño no puede bastar. para dormir sobre la cama fría. de mi infidelidad. Tus mil promesas no las mantendrás. Yo quiero estar colgada aún al hilo. Bailarle al cielo más de un vals.

Ma, in realtà, siamo noi. E lo aspetti ad un telefono. Litigando che sai libero. con il cuore nel lo stomaco. Un gomitolo nell'angolo. Lì da sola, dentro un brivido. Ma perché lui non c'è. E sono strani amori che. Fanno crescere e sorridere. Fra le lacrime. Quante pagine lì da scrivere. Sogni e lividi da dividere. Sono amori che spesso a questa età. Si confondono dentro a quest'anima. Che si interroga senza decidere. Se è un amore che va per noi. E quante notte perse a piangere. Rileggendo quelle lettere. Che non riesci più a buttare via. Dal labirinto della nostalgia. Grandi amori che finiscono. Ma perché restano nel cuore. Strani amori che vanno e vengono. Nei pensieri che lì nascondono. Storie vere che ci appartengono. Ma si lasciano come noi. Strani amori fragili. Prigionieri, liberi. Strani amori mettono nei guai. Ma, in realtà, siamo noi. Strani amori fragili. Prigionieri, liberi. Strani amori che non sanno vivere. E si perdono dentro noi. Mi dispiace devo andare via. Questa volta l'ho promesso a me. Perché ho voglia ad un amore vero. Senza te"

Caminando indiferente, vida mía.. Culpa de un verano. Del perfume de una noche de un momento que.... Que nunca olvidaré.. Guiados del deseo de sentirnos. De repente siempre más cercanos. Casi quemándonos.. Ya es demasiado tarde, ni lo pienses. No es momento de olvidar y renacer. De no buscarte más. Mas no sé qué es importante. Si fiarme o no fiarme de ti. De ese rostro tan impreso aquí en mi mente,. No lo sé, pero pienso siempre en ti.. Nada existe. Que me borre el recuerdo de ti. Tu mirada soñadora y diferente. Dónde estás, dime, ahora dónde estás..

Through the cold Grey morning and the city rain. Thinking of somebody else who'll run to him. Who'll ask him Did you miss me maybe now and then?. Laughing he'll say Well I met this funny girl,. But just a summer thing I won't see her again. Oh God I hope I'm wrong. But I'm not feeling very strong. I've been so up and down so sad. So happy feeling good and bad. I'm young I'm old I laugh I cry. I tell the truth but that's a lie. I've been so in and out so wild. so well behaved so pure defiled. It’s only to demand. That’s why I hate to say. The night I’d. The night I’d. And no I wasn't crazy to do what we did. I even wish I'd been a bit more crazy still. And kept a little more of him to see me through. He loved me all he could I never had my fill. And then I'm back inside my room he knows so well. I feel again the way he moved I take it slow. I talk to him and he becomes a part of me. And then I know he'll never let the summer go. Oh God I hope I'm right. I won't give in without a fight. And I can take the words they throw. At me for none of them could know. That we had something very few. Will ever find their whole life through. I wouldn't change a single day. Although the price I have to pay. Is all this loneliness. An emptiness that's breaking me apart. It tears me up it pulls me down and then. It wraps around my heart. It’s only truth that makes us see. Does he remember all he said to me. I've been so up and down so sad. So happy feeling good and bad. I'm young I'm old I laugh I cry. I tell the truth but that's a lie. I've been so in and out so wild. So well behaved so pure defiled. But oh this loneliness.

Che adesso rimpiango,. Che adesso vorrei.. Pianterò. Davanti a casa mia. Un albero per te.. Ti dico ciao,. Salutami dio. E digli che tu. Sei l’ amico mio."

Llora conmigo hasta que el cielo sea cielo. hasta que el frío que hoy sentimos se convierta en fuego. hasta que llore el mar. y el beso que quedó vacío ocupe su lugar. y todo vuelva a empezar. Pasan las tardes sin mirar, sin ver. nos aguantamos el cariño. por no portarmos como niños. Mejor sentarme al borde de tu piel. que echarles sal a las heridas. de quien más amo en esta vida. La calma está por llegar. en cuanto aclare la tormenta. nos vamos a encontrar. Llora conmigo hasta que el cielo sea cielo. hasta que el frío que hoy sentimos se convierta en fuego. hasta que llore el mar. y el beso que quedó vacío ocupe su lugar. y todo vuelva a empezar.

Ed io ti porterò. Dentro le mie tasche ovunque andrai. Come una moneta, un amuleto. Che tra le mie mani, stringerò.. Sei la mia prigione. L'evasione dentro me. L'evasione dentro me. Oltre la ragione. Solamente io conosco cosa c'è. Quell'amore che ho per te.. Io ti porterò. Dentro le mie tasche ovunque andrai.. Come un incantesimo segreto. Per I giorni vuoti che vivrò. Per inseguirte in ogni viaggio che farai. Dentro le mie tasche ovunque andrai. Come una moneta, un amuleto. Che tra le mie mani, stringerò."

Tú eres quien dice que el suelo frío no está. Y eso me lleva a echar hoy por tierra el dolor. No había un sitio mejor. Será que la amistad se ahogó en tu sangre fría. Que tu fidelidad se refugió en la mía. No te acompaño ya porque no hay más razones. Pobres verdades a medias, son media verdad. Mi corazón agotado me ha dado el aviso. Siempre obstinado, siempre así mismo fiel. Te has convertido en el viento helado de Octubre. Mejor aliado no tuve. Será que la amistad se ahogó en tu sangre fría. Que tu fidelidad se refugió en la mía. No te acompaño ya porque no hay más razones. Pobres verdades a medias, son media verdad. Y mueren las frases a medias por no ser verdad. Tirémoslo todo, deprisa que poco te importa. Incluso la rabia se ha ido. Al ver que no es nada lo poco que queda. Cuánta violencia usaste al decirme te quiero. Fue inútil como un disparo. Será que la amistad se ahogó en tu sangre fría. Que tu fidelidad se refugió en la mía. Ya no querré cambiar todas tus convicciones. Mueren las frases a medias por ser la mitad"

È un dolore quando parte. (Vivo per lei dentro gli hotels). Con piacere estremo cresce. (Vivo per lei nel vortice). Attraverso la mia voce. Si espande e amore produce. Vivo per lei, nient'altro ho. E quanti altri incontrerò. Che come me hanno scritto in viso. Io vivo per lei. Io vivo per lei. Sopra un palco o contro un muro. (Vivo per lei al limite). ...Anche in un domani duro. (Vivo per lei al margine). Ogni giorno. Una conquista. La protagonista. Sarà sempre lei. Vivo per lei perchè oramai. Io non ho altra via d'uscita. Perchè la musica, lo sai. Davvero non l'ho mai tradita. Vivo per lei perchè mi dà. Pause e note in libertà. Ci fosse un'altra vita la vivo. La vivo per lei. Vivo per lei la musica. Io vivo per lei. Vivo per lei è unica.

When the night falls i'll still be standing. Cause you'll always be right here in my heart. And in my deepest memories. I will never have to be without you. Love is like a work of art. Once you feel it you hold it in your heart. You know forever that its true. So kiss me for always. Even if I live my life without you. Cause I love you without and ending.

Nos espera en la frontera. Con el auto bloqueado. Mas el rock habra pasado. La musica ha llegado. Es un rock, bambino. Un sabor mas bien latino. Y asi su pasaporte. Lo seguimos corriendo fuerte. Que penetra en los muros. Hace brecha en la puerta. Hasta el fondo el te dice. Que tu alma no esta muerta. Y no despierten no, no, no, todavia no. Y no nos paren no, no, no, todavia no. Y mi banda toca el rock. Es una eterna salida. Llega bien en ondas medias. Y en frecuencia modulada. Es un rock bambino. Un sabor mas bien latino. Esta musica es esperanza. Esta musica es pasion.

Quiero cantarle. Siempre cantarle. El aroma del café en la cocina. La casa que se llena de alegría. El ascensor que no va. El amor a mi ciudad. La gente que sonreirá son de mi calle. Las ramas que se cruzan hacia el cielo. Un viejo que camina en solitario. El verano que nos dejará. El trivo que madurará. La mano que lo acojerá. Por esto y por lo que será. Yo canto. Tranquilamente canto. La voz en fiesta, canto. La banda en fiesta, canto. Corriendo al viento. Canto. La vida entera canto. La primavera, canto. Rezando también canto. Alguien me escuchará.

Con tus mentiras por la libertad. Por mi libertad. Oh oh oh. Oh oh oh. Si yo pudiese echar atrás el tiempo. Con él te arrastraría a ti también. Te haría vivir lo que yo ya he vivido. Que lo hicieses todo con mi ingenuidad. Así. Allí estuve. Y aún recuerdo todo el dolor. Yo estuve. Y busco el amor, por favor. Yo estuve. Me merecía sólo atención. Allí estuve y ahora yo quiero. Más amor, por favor"
2,laura-pausini,You Are,"Used to be afraid of love. Used to be alone. Never thought I'd find someone to lean a bond. Like a blessing from above. You came in to my life. When my faith was gone. Somehow you found me. You took my hand when I was lost. Embraced me with your love. In your arms is where I belong. You are my shelter. My tears and laughter. The sunlight and the wind. You are my angel. You are the joy that love can bring. Love will grow and takes us high. Love has just begun. And I do believe nothing can bring us down. I can see it in your eyes. The fail will never fade. Cause in my heart I know. To be there beside you. To hold you when you're down and out. Embrace you with my love. Cause in my heart is where you belong. You are my shelter. My tears and laughter. The sunlight and the wind. You are my angel. You are the joy that love can bring. You are my everything. You are the joy that love can bring. Yes you are. Oh baby. You are my tears and laughter baby, baby, baby. You are the wind. You are my angel. You are the joy that love can bring. Your love surrounds me. Oh Baby don't you know you're my everything.

3,evanescence,My Immortal,"I'm so tired of being here. Suppressed by all my childish fears. And if you have to leave, I wish that you would just leave. 'Cause your presence still lingers here. And it won't leave me alone. These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. And I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me. You used to captivate me by your resonating light. Now I'm bound by the life you've left behind. Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams. Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me. These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. And I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me. I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone. But though you're still with me. I've been alone all along. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. And I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me"

I can't go on living this way. But I can't go back the way I came. Chained of this fear. That I will never find the way. To heal my soul. And I will wander till the end of time. Half alive without you. My heart is broken. Sweet sleep, my dark angel. Deliver us. Change. Open your eyes to the light. I denied it all so long, oh so long. Say goodbye. Goodbye. My heart is broken. Release me, I can't hold on. Deliver us. My heart is broken. Sweet sleep, my dark angel. Deliver us. My heart is broken. Sweet sleep, my dark angel. Deliver us from sorrow's hold."
3,evanescence,Imaginary,I linger in the doorway. Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name. Let me stay. Where the wind will whisper to me. Where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story. In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby. I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me. Don't say I'm out of touch. With this rampant chaos - your reality. I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge. The nightmare I built my own world to escape. In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby. I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me. Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming. Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights. Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming. The goddess of imaginary light. In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby. I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me
3,evanescence,Good Enough,"Under your spell again. I can't say no to you. Crave my heart and it's bleeding in your hand. I can't say no to you. Shouldn't have let you torture me so sweetly.

And I've completely lost myself and I don't mind. I can't say no to you. Shouldn't have let you conquer me completely. Now I can't let go of this dream. Can't believe that I feel. Good enough. I feel good enough. It's been such a long time coming, but I feel good. And I'm still waiting for the rain to fall. Pour real life down on me. Cause I can't hold on to anything this. Good enough. Am I good enough. For you to love me too?. So take care what you ask of me. Cause I can't say no"
3,evanescence,Tourniquet,I tried to kill the pain. But only brought more (so much more). I lay dying. And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal. I'm dying praying bleeding and screaming.

Will you be on the other side. Or will you forget me. I'm dying praying bleeding and screaming. Am I too lost to be saved. Am I too lost?. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. I want to die. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. My wounds cry for the grave.

Don't leave me here without you. 'Cause I could never. Replace your perfect imperfection. The way you look us over. Your counterfeit composure. Pushing again and again and sinking lower and lower. The world is on our shoulders. Do you really know the weight of the words you say?. You want a little of it. You just can't let go of it. You've got an ego to feed. Too late to rise above it. Don't look now but the little girl's got a grenade. I'm gonna lift you up. Into the light. That you deserve. I'm gonna take you down. To the real world. So you can watch it burn. Don't you dare surrender. Don't leave me here without you. 'Cause I could never. Replace your perfect imperfection. We stand undefined. Can't be drawn with a straight line.

[God knows what lies behind them]. Don't turn out the light. [Never sleep, never die]. I'm frightened by what I see. But somehow I know that there's much more to come. Immobilized by my fear. And soon to be blinded by tears. I can stop the pain if I will it all away. If I will it all away. Don't turn away. [Don't give in to the pain]. Don't try to hide. [Though they're screaming your name]. Don't close your eyes. [God knows what lies behind them]. Don't turn out the light. [Never sleep, never die]. Fallen angels at my feet. Whispered voices at my ear. Death before my eyes. Lying next to me I fear. She beckons me shall I give in. Upon my end shall I begin. Forsaking all I've fallen for I rise to meet the end. Don't turn away. [Don't give in to the pain]. Don't try to hide. [Though they're screaming your name]. Don't close your eyes. [God knows what lies behind them]. Don't turn out the light. [Never sleep never die]"

Just to let you down. You believed in me, but I'm broken. I have nothing left. And all I feel is this cruel wanting. We've been falling for all this time. And now I'm lost in paradise. As much as I'd like. The past not to exist. It still does. As much as I'd like. To feel like I belong here. I'm just as scared as you. I have nothing left. And all I feel is this cruel wanting. We've been falling for all this time. And now I'm lost in paradise. Run away, run away. One day we won't feel this pain anymore. Take it all away. Shadows of you. 'Cause they won't let me go. Till I have nothing left. And all I feel is this cruel wanting. We've been falling for all this time. And now I'm lost in paradise. Alone and lost in paradise"
3,evanescence,Taking Over Me,You don't remember me but I remember you. I lie awake and try so hard not to think of you. But who can decide what they dream?. And dream I do.... I believe in you. I'll give up everything just to find you. I have to be with you to live to breathe. You're taking over me. Have you forgotten all I know. And all we had?. You saw me mourning my love for you. And touched my hand. I knew you loved me then. I believe in you. I'll give up everything just to find you. I have to be with you to live to breathe. you're taking over me. I look in the mirror and see your face. If i look deep enough. So many things inside that are just like you are taking over. believe in you. I'll give up everything just to find you. I have to be with you to live to breathe. You're taking over me
3,evanescence,4th Of July,Shower in the dark day. Clean sparks driving down. Cool in the waterway. Where the baptized drown. Naked in the cold sun. Breathing life like fire. Thought I was the only one. But that was just a lie. Cause I heard it in the wind. And I saw it in the sky. And I thought it was the end. And I thought it was the 4th of July. Pale in the flare light. The scared light cracks & disappears. And leads the scorched ones here. And everywhere no one cares. The fire is spreading. And no one wants to speak about it. Down in the hole. Jesus tries to crack a smile. Beneath another shovel load. And I heard it in the wind. And I saw it in the sky. And I thought it was the end. And I thought it was the 4th of July. Now I'm in control. Now I'm in the fall out. Once asleep but now I stand. And I still remember. Your sweet everything. Light a Roman candle. And hold it in your hand. Cause I heard it in the wind. And I saw it in the sky. And I thought it was the end. And I thought it was the 4th of July
3,evanescence,All That I'm Living For,All that I'm living for. All that I'm dying for. All that I can't ignore alone at night. I can feel the night beginning. Separate me from the living. Understanding me. After all I've seen. Piecing every thought together. Find the words to make me better. If I only knew how to pull myself apart. All that I'm living for. All that I'm dying for. All that I can't ignore alone at night. All that I'm wanted for. Although I wanted more. Lock the last open door. My ghosts are gaining on me. I believe that dreams are sacred. Take my darkest fears and play them. Like a lullaby. Like a reason why. Like a play of my obsessions. Make me understand the lesson. So I'll find myself. So I wont be lost again. All that I'm living for. All that I'm dying for. All that I can't ignore alone at night. All that I'm wanted for. Although I wanted more. Lock the last open door. My ghosts are gaining on me. Guess I thought I'd have to change the world. To make you see me. To be the one. I could have run forever. But how far would I have come. Without mourning your love?. All that I'm living for. All that I'm dying for. All that I can't ignore alone at night. All that I'm wanted for. Although I wanted more. Lock the last open door. My ghosts are gaining on me. Should it hurt to love you?. Should I feel like I do?. Should I lock the last open door?. My ghosts are gaining on me
3,evanescence,All That I'm Living For (traducción),"Todo por lo que vivo. Todo por lo que muero. Todo lo que no puedo ignorar, sola a la noche. Puedo sentir la noche comenzando. Me separa de la vida. Entendiéndome. Después de todo lo que he visto. Reconstruyendo cada penamiento. Encuentro las palabras para mejorarme. Si sólo supiera como hacerme pedazos. Todo por lo que vivo. Todo por lo que muero. Todo lo que no puedo ignorar, sola a la noche. Todo por lo que me quieren. Aunque quería más. Cerrá la última puerta abierta. Mis fantasmas se me están acercando. Creo que los sueños son sagrados. Toma mis miedos más oscuros y tócalos. Como una canción de cuna. Como una razón. Como un juego de mis obsesiones. Hacéme entender la lección. Así me encontraré. Entonces no estaré perdida otra vez. Todo por lo que vivo. Todo por lo que muero. Todo lo que no puedo ignorar, sola a la noche. Todo por lo que me quieren. Aunque quería más. Cerrá la última puerta abierta. Mis fantasmas se me están acercando. Supongo que pensé que tendría que cambiar el mundo. Para hacer que me vieras. Para ser la única. Podría haber corrido para siempre. ¿Pero cuán lejos podría haber llegado sin lamentar tu amor?. Todo por lo que vivo. Todo por lo que muero. Todo lo que no puedo ignorar, sola a la noche. Todo por lo que me quieren. Aunque quería más. Cerrá la última puerta abierta. Mis fantasmas se me están acercando. ¿Debería doler amarte?. ¿Debería sentirme así?. ¿Debería cerrar la última puerta abierta?. Mis fantasmas se me están acercando"

Lost all faith in the things I have achieved. And I. [CHORUS:]. I've woken now to find myself. In the shadows of all I have created. I'm longing to be lost in you. (away from this place I have made). Won't you take me away from me. Crawling through this world as disease flows through my veins. I look into myself, but my own heart has been changed. I can't go on like this. I loathe all I've become. [Chorus]. Lost in a dying world I reach for something more. I have grown so weary of this lie I live. [Chorus]. I've woken now to find myself. I'm lost in the shadows on my own. I'm longing to be lost in you. Away from me"

3,evanescence,Bleed (I Must Be Dreaming),How can I pretend that I don't see. What you hide so carelessly?. I saw her bleed. You heard me breathe. And I froze inside myself. And turned away. I must be dreaming. We all live. We all die. That does not begin to justify you. It's not what it seems. Not what you think. No I must be dreaming. It's only in my mind. Not in real life. No I must be dreaming. Help you know I've got to tell someone. Tell them what I know you've done. I fear you but spoken fears can come true. We all live. We all die.

3,evanescence,Breathe No More,"I've been looking in a mirror for so long. That I've come to believe my soul's on the other side. All the little pieces falling, shattered. Shards of me too sharp to put back together. Too small to matter. But big enough to cut me into so many. Little pieces if I try to touch her. And I bleed. I bleed. And I breathe. I breathe, no more. I take a breath and I try to draw from my spirits well. Yet again you refuse to drink. Like a stubborn child. Lie to me convince me that I've been sick forever. And all of this will make sense when I get better. But I know the difference between myself and my reflection. I just can't help but to wonder which of us do you love. So I bleed. I bleed. And I breathe. I breathe no. Bleed. I bleed. And I breathe. I breathe. I breathe. I breathe, no more"

Si tratara de tocarla,. Y sangro,. Sangro,. Y respiro,. No respiro más.. Respiro y trato de. halar el bienestar de mi alma.. Aún así, te niegas a beber. como un niño testarudo.. Miénteme,. convénceme de que siempre estuve enferma.. Y todo esto tendrá sentido. cuando mejore. Conozco la diferencia,. Entre yo y mi reflejo,.

Where did you go?. Grim and Evil, how I love that little brain. Johnny Bravo, can I smack you once again?. I hope you've learned a lesson here. Treasure what you have. Don't make the mistake I made. The rockstar life is sad. Well, living on a tour bus is pretty bad. And now I'm sure I know. The meaning of my life. The love within my soul. The reason I wake up each day and it's. Cartoon Network. I miss you so. My Cartoon Network. Where did you go?. My Cartoon Network"

I still believe you can. Don't you want to feel?. Don't you want to live your life?. How much longer are you gonna give into the fear?. I can't go on pretending so give me something real. No one in your way but you. How much longer are you gonna give into the fear?. Holding you down 'till you disappear"
3,evanescence,End Of The Dream,I found a grave. Brushed off the face. Felt your light. And I remember why I know this place. I found a bird. Closing her eyes. One last time. And I wonder if she dreamed like me. As much as it hurts ain't it wonderful to feel?. So go on and break your wings. Follow your heart till it bleeds. As we run towards the end of the dream. I'm not afraid. I push through the pain. And I'm on fire. I remember how to breathe again. As much as it hurts ain't it wonderful to feel?. So go on and bring your wings. Follow your heart till it bleeds. As we run towards the end of the dream. Why must we fall apart to understand how to fly?. I will find a way even without wings. Follow your heart till it bleeds. As we run towards the end of the dream. Follow your heart till it bleeds. And we've come to the end of the dream
3,evanescence,Erase This,It's too late to change your mind. Even though this fragile world. Is tearing apart at the seams. I can't wash these sins away. This sinking feeling everyday. I'm waking up with someone else's life. Is it so hard for you?. 'Cause it's so hard for me. To believe that what we dreamed. Could ever come to life again. 'Cause I cannot erase this lie. I'm not gonna let this day go by. I'm gonna save this wasted life. And nothing can stand in my way. Not enough to say goodbye. Burn it till there's nothing left. I'm drowning in the mess that i have made. Is it so hard for you?. 'Cause it's so hard for me. To believe that what we dreamed. Could ever come to life again. 'Cause I cannot erase this dark in me. The water's rising around us. There is no other way down. I only have myself to blame For it all. Is it so hard for you?. 'Cause it's so hard for me. To believe that what we dreamed. Could ever come to life again. If I could just erase my mind. But i cannot erase this lie

3,evanescence,Exodus,"My black backpack's stuffed with broken dreams. Twenty bucks should get me through the week. Never said a word of discontentment. Thought it a thousand times but now. I'm leaving home. Here in the shadows. I'm safe, I'm free. I've nowhere else to go. but I cannot stay where I don't belong. Two months passed by and it's getting cold. I know I'm not lost I'm just alone. But I won't cry, I won't give up, I can't go back now. Waking up is knowing who you really are. Here in the shadows. I'm safe, I'm free. I've nowhere else to go. but I cannot stay where I don't belong. In the shadows. I'm safe, I'm free. I've nowhere else to go. but I cannot stay here. Oh, show me the shadow where true meaning lies. So much more dismay in empty eyes."

Lo he luchado mil veces pero ahora. Estoy dejando casa. [CORO]. Aquí en las sombras. Estoy segura. Soy libre. No tengo un lugar donde ir pero. No puedo quedarme donde no pertenezco. Pasan dos meses y está poniéndose frío. Sé que no estoy perdida. Simplemente estoy sola. Pero no lloraré. No me rendiré. No puedo regresar ahora. Despertando sé quién realmente eres. [El coro]. [El coro]. Muéstreme la sombra dónde la verdad significa mentiras. Mucho más es hecho en los ojos vacíos

3,evanescence,Field Of Innocence,"I still remember the world. From the eyes of a child. Slowly those feelings. Were clouded by what I know now. Where has my heart gone?.

3,evanescence,Imaginary,I linger in the doorway. Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name. Let me stay. Where the wind will whisper to me. Where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story. In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby. I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me. Don't say I'm out of touch. With this rampant chaos - your reality. I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge. The nightmare I built my own world to escape. In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby. I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me. Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming. Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights. Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming. The goddess of imaginary light. In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby. I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me

3,evanescence,Lose Control,"You don't remember my name. I don't really care. Can we play the game your way?. Can I really lose control?. Just once in my life. I think it'd be nice. Just to lose control, just once. With all the pretty flowers in the dust. Mary had a lamb. His eyes black as coals. If we play very quiet, my lamb. Mary never has to know. Just once in my life. I think it'd be nice. Just to lose control, just once. If I cut you down to a thing I can use. I fear there will be nothing good left of you"
3,evanescence,Lost In Paradise,"I've been believing. In something so distant. As if I was human. And I've been denying. This feeling of hopelessness. In me, in me. All the promises I made. Just to let you down. You believed in me, but I'm broken. I have nothing left. And all I feel is this cruel wanting. We've been falling for all this time. And now I'm lost in paradise. As much as I'd like. The past not to exist. It still does. As much as I'd like. To feel like I belong here. I'm just as scared as you. I have nothing left. And all I feel is this cruel wanting. We've been falling for all this time. And now I'm lost in paradise. Run away, run away. One day we won't feel this pain anymore. Take it all away. Shadows of you. 'Cause they won't let me go. Till I have nothing left. And all I feel is this cruel wanting. We've been falling for all this time. And now I'm lost in paradise. Alone and lost in paradise"

3,evanescence,My Heart Is Broken,"I will wander till the end of time. Torn away from you. I pulled away to face the pain. I close my eyes and drift away. Over the fear. That I will never find a way. To heal my soul. And I will wander till the end of time. Torn away from you. My heart is broken. Sweet sleep, my dark angel. Deliver us from sorrow's hold. Over my heart, heart. I can't go on living this way. But I can't go back the way I came. Chained of this fear. That I will never find the way. To heal my soul. And I will wander till the end of time. Half alive without you. My heart is broken. Sweet sleep, my dark angel. Deliver us. Change. Open your eyes to the light. I denied it all so long, oh so long. Say goodbye. Goodbye. My heart is broken. Release me, I can't hold on. Deliver us. My heart is broken. Sweet sleep, my dark angel. Deliver us. My heart is broken. Sweet sleep, my dark angel. Deliver us from sorrow's hold."
3,evanescence,My Immortal,"I'm so tired of being here. Suppressed by all my childish fears. And if you have to leave, I wish that you would just leave. 'Cause your presence still lingers here. And it won't leave me alone. These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. And I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me. You used to captivate me by your resonating light. Now I'm bound by the life you've left behind. Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams. Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me. These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. And I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me. I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone. But though you're still with me. I've been alone all along. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears.

3,evanescence,My Immortal (traducción),Estoy tan cansada de estar aquí. Suprimida por todos mi miedos infantiles. Y si debes irte. Desearía que simplemente te fueras. Porque tu presencia aún persiste aquí. Y no me deja sola. Estas heridas parecen no sanar. Este dolor es demasiado real. Hay tanto que el tiempo no puede borrar. Cuando lloraste te sequé las lágrimas. Cuando gritaste alejé todos tus miedos. Y sostuve tu mano a través de estos años. Pero todavía lo tienes todo de mí. Solías cautivarme por tu resonante luz. Pero ahora estoy aferrada a la vida. Que has dejado atrás. Tu cara persigue los que alguna vez fueron. Sueños placenteros. Tu voz ha alejado toda mi racionalidad. Estas heridas parecen no sanar. Este dolor es demasiado real. Hay tanto que el tiempo no puede borrar. Cuando lloraste te sequé las lágrimas. Cuando gritaste alejé todos tus miedos. Y sostuve tu mano a través de estos años. Pero todavía lo tienes todo de mí. Traté de convencerme de que te has ido. Y aunque aún sigues conmigo. Siempre he estado sola. Cuando lloraste te sequé las lágrimas. Cuando gritaste alejé todos tus miedos. Y sostuve tu mano a través de estos años. Pero todavía lo tienes todo de mí

3,evanescence,My Last Breath,Hold on to me love. You know I can't stay long. All I wanted to say was I love you. And I'm not afraid. Can you hear me?. Can you feel me in your arms?. Chorus:. Holding my last breath. Safe inside myself. Are all my thoughts of you. Sweet raptured light. It ends here tonight. I'll miss the winter. A world of fragile things. Look for me in the white forest. Hiding in a hollow tree. (Come find me). I know you hear me. I can taste it in your tears. Chorus:. Holding my last breath. Safe inside myself. Are all my thoughts of you. Sweet raptured light. It ends here tonight. Closing your eyes to disappear. You pray your dreams. Will leave you here. But still you wake and know the truth. No one's there. Say goodnight. Don't be afraid. Calling me calling me. As you fade to black. Holding my last breath. Safe inside myself. Are all my thoughts of you. Sweet raptured light. It ends here tonight
3,evanescence,My Last Breath (traducción),"aferrate a mi amor. sabes que no me puedo quedar mucho. todo lo que quisiste decir fue te quiero. y no tengo miedo. ¿puedes oirme?. ¿puedes sentirme en tus brazos?. aguantando mi ultimo respiro. a salvo dentro de mi. ¿son todos mies pensamientos sobre ti?. dulce luz quebrada que termina esta noche. me perdi el invierno. un mundo de cosas fragiles. buscame en el bosque blanco. escondida en un arbol hueco(y encuentrame). se que me escuchas. puedo saborearlo en tus lagrimas. aguantando mi ultimo respiro.... pierde los ojos para temer. libera tus sueños, pero permanece aquí. pero mientras esperes para conocer la verdad. ¡no hay nadie ahí!. di buenas noches. no temas. llamame. llamame. mientras te fundes a negro. aguantando mi ultimo respiro..."
3,evanescence,Never Go Back,"Everything is so dark. And I know there's something wrong but I can't turn the light on. In that split second change. When you knew we couldn't hold on. I realized I live to love you. Save yourself!. Don't look back!. Tearing us apart until it's all gone. The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves. But I remember. I won't give up on you. I can feel you in my heart just show me the way. I don't belong here. Alone. I can still see your face. Where it's burned into my mind. I die every time. I close my eyes, you're always there. Save yourself!. Don't look back!. Tearing us apart until it's all gone. The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves. But I'm the one who's drowning. Without your love. I am lost and I can never go back home. All across the ocean. We are calling. Calling.... Ah. Ah, are you there?. Nothing left for me 'till I find you because it's. All gone. The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves. But I'm the one who's drowning. Without your love. I am lost and I can never go back. I can never go back home"
3,evanescence,New Way To Bleed,"Save your twisted enemy. So you might earn forgiveness. You know your whole world is waiting. So why can't you speak?. I feel it coming over me. I'm still a slave to these dreams. Is this the end of everything?. Or just a new way to bleed?. So go and tell all your friends. That I'm a failure underneath. If it makes you feel like a bigger man. But it's my, my heart, my life that you're calling a lie. I've played this game before. And I can't take anymore. I feel it coming over me. I'm still a slave to these dreams. Is this the end of everything?. Or just a new way to bleed?. By drifting far beyond the end. Freedom, freedom can't you feel the ground caving in?. Freedom, give us a reason to believe again. I feel it coming over me. I'm still a slave to these dreams. Is this the end of everything?. Or just a new way to bleed?"

Or just a new way to bleed?"
3,evanescence,Oceans,Don't want to be the one to walk away. But I can't bear the thought of one more day. I think I finally understand what it means to be lost. Can't find the road to lead us out of this. A million miles from where we burned the bridge. Can't keep pretending everything's gonna be alright. With the whole world. Falling around me. Cross the oceans in my mind. Find the strength to say goodbye. In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands. Fallen so far from where we were before. You'll never find what you've been searching for. Something to fill the void and make up for all of those missing pieces of you. Like I could only dream to do. Cross the oceans in my mind. Find the strength to say goodbye. Everything that we believed in was a lie. Cross the oceans in your mind. Find a way to blur the line. In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands. And we never learn. So we fall down again. Heaven help me find a way to dream. Within this nightmare. Cross the oceans in my mind. Find the strength to say goodbye. Everything that we believed in was a lie. Cross the oceans in your mind. Find a way to blur the line. In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands

3,evanescence,October (Espanhol),"No puedo huir nunca más. Caí antes que tú. Aquí estoy. No tengo nada más. Aunque he tratado de olvidarte. Tú eres todo lo que tengo. Llevame a casa. Estoy combatiéndolo. Rota muerta. Yo doy todo. Tú eres mi única fuerza. Sin ti yo. No puedo seguir. Nunca más nunca otra vez. Mi única esperanza (todo este tiempo e tratado). Mi única paz (de caminar sin ti). Mi única alegría, mi única fuerza. (Caí en tú abundante gracia). Mi ùnico poder, mi única vida. (Y el amor esta donde yo estoy) mi ùnico amor. No puedo huir nunca más. Lo siento, lo siento. Con mucha amargura. Yo ignore todo lo real y verdadero. Todo lo que necesito eres tú. Cuando la noche cae sobre mí. No cerrare mis ojos. Estoy viva. Y tú estas tan decidido. No puedo mentir más. Caigo antes que tú. Lo siento, lo siento. Constantemente ignoro el dolor que meconsume. Pero esta vez es demasiado profundo. No me perderé de vuelta"
3,evanescence,Orestes,"Metaphor for a missing moment. Pull me in to your perfect circle. One womb, One shame, One resolve. Liberate this will. To release us all. Gotta cut away, clear away,. Snip away and severe this. Umbilical residue. Keeping me from killing you. And from pulling you down with me here. I can almost hear you scream. One more medicated peaceful moment (give me). One more medicated peaceful moment. And I don't wanna feel this overwhelming hostility. No, I don't wanna feel this overwhelming hostility. Gotta cut away clear away. Snip away and sever this umbilical residue. Gotta cut away clear away. Snip away and sever this umbilical residue. Keeping me from killing you. Keeping me from killing you"

3,evanescence,People Are Strange,People are strange. When you're a stranger. Faces look ugly when you're alone. Women seem wicked. When you're unwanted. Streets are uneven. When you're down. When you're strange. Faces come out of the rain. When you're strange. One remembers your name. When you're strange
3,evanescence,Sally's Song,"I sense there's something in the wind. That feels like tragedy's at hand. And though I'd like to stand by him. Can't shake this feeling that I have. The worst is just around the bend. And does he notice my feelings for him?. And will he see how much he means to me?. I think it's not to be. What will become of my dear friend?. Where will his actions lead us then?. Although I'd like to join the crowd. In their enthusiastic cloud. Try as I may, it doesn't last. And will we ever end up together?. And will we ever end up together?. no, I think not, it's never to become. For I am not the one"
3,evanescence,Say You Will,"It's taking you too long to decide. And I don't want to be the one, the one. Crying over wasting time. If you think you're strong enough to let me in. Then come on, stand up and be honest, be honest. I'm tired of feeling so alone. Cause you won't let me understand (let me understand). I don't want to pretend. I want to feel, I want to live. Say you will or say you won't. Open your heart to me. Now or never tell the truth. Is this real, is this real?. Whenever you're around I can't fight it. You get under my skin in a way that I like it. And I can't take anymore. Tell me what you want from me. Or leave me alone. Cause I'm all caught up. And I'm losing control. I'm tired of holding on so tight. When you won't let me understand (let me understand). Now I'm falling apart. I never meant to lose myself. Say you will or say you won't. Open your heart to me. Now or never tell the truth. Is this real, is this real?. Say you will or say you won't. Open your heart to me. Now or never tell the truth. Is this real, is this real?. Like drops of rain against my heart. Cut through like silver. And I want to make you feel that way. And I want to make you feel the way that I do. Say you will or say you won't. Open your heart to me. Now or never tell the truth. Is this real?. Say you will or say you wont. open your heart to me. Now or never tell the truth. Is this real, is this real?"
3,evanescence,Secret Door,"Turn out the lights. Feed the fire till my soul breaks free. My heart is high as the waves above me. Don't need to understand. Too lost to lose. Don't fight my tears, cause they feel so good. And I, I will remember how to fly. Unlock the heavens in my mind. Follow my love back through the same secret door. Look past the end. It's a dream, as it's always been. All life lives on if we've ever loved it. And I, I will remember how to fly. Unlock the heavens in my mind. Follow my love back through the same secret door"
3,evanescence,Sick,"Embrace the silence. 'Cause there's nothing that can change the way I feel. Taken all that you wanted. Now there's nothing that can change the way I feel. Hold on, little girl. The end is soon to come. Sick of it all. Sick of it all. We will not follow. Sick of it all. Sick of it all. They don't understand how. Sick we are, sick we are. Of this bottomless pit of lies. Behind closed eyes. Oceans between us. And there's nothing that can change the way I feel. I can still taste the poison. Of every thought. Every breathe I wasted here. Hold on, little girl. The end is soon to come. Sick of it all. Sick of it all. We will not follow. Sick of it all. Sick of it all. They don't understand how. Sick we are, sick we are. Of this bottomless pit of lies. Behind closed eyes. Someday you'll know the pain. Someday the light will break through. And nothing you tell yourself will save us from the truth. Screaming out. Sick of it all. Sick of it all. We will not follow. Sick of it all. Sick of it all. They don't understand how. Sick we are, sick we are. Of this bottomless pit of lies. Behind closed eyes"
3,evanescence,Snow White Queen,"Stoplight lock the door. Don't look back. Undress in the dark. And hide from you. All of you. You'll never know the way your words have haunted me. I can't believe you'd ask these things of me. You don't know me, now and ever. You belong to me. My Snow White Queen. There's nowhere to run, so lets just get it over. Soon I know you'll see. You're just like me. Don't scream anymore my love, cause all I want is you. Wake up in a dream. Frozen fear. All your hands on me. I can't scream. I can't escape the twisted way you think of me. I feel you in my dreams and I don't sleep. I don't sleep. You belong to me. My Snow White Queen. There's nowhere to run, so lets just get it over. Soon I know you'll see. You're just like me. Don't scream anymore my love, cause all I want is you. I can't save your life. Though nothing I bleed for is more tormenting. I'm losing my mind. And you just stand there and stare as my world divides. You belong to me. My Snow White Queen. There's nowhere to run, so lets just get it over. Soon I know you'll see. You're just like me. Don't scream anymore my love, cause all I want is you. All I want is you. All I want is you. All I want is you"
3,evanescence,So Close,"I've spent so much time. Throwing rocks at your window. That I never even knocked. On the front door. I walk by statues. Never even made one chip. But if I could leave a mark. On the monument of the heart. I just might lay myself down for a little more than I had. The last day, the last day, the last day. Wait a time. To spare these lies we tell ourselves. These days have come and gone. But this time is sweeter than honey"
3,evanescence,Solitude,"How many times have you told me you love her. As many times as I've wanted to tell you the truth. How long have I stood here beside you. I live through you. You looked through me. Ooh, Solitude,. Still with me is only you. Ooh, Solitude,. I can't stay away from you. How many times have I done this to myself. How long will it take before I see. When will this hole in my heart be mended. Who now is left alone but me. Ooh, Solitude,. Forever me and forever you. Ooh, Solitude,. Only you, only true. Everyone leave me stranded. Forgotten, abandoned, left behind. I can't stay here another night. Your secret admirer. Who could it be. Ooh, Can't you see. All along it was me. How can you be so blind. As to see right through me. And Ooh, Solitude,. Still with me is only you. Ooh, Solitude,. I can't stay away from you. Ooh, Solitude,. Forever me and forever you. Ooh, Solitude,. Only you, only true"
3,evanescence,Surrender,"Is this real enough for you?. You were so confused. Now that you?ve decided to stay. We?ll remain together. (Chorus). You can?t abandon me, you belong to me.

Everything is perfect now, we can live forever. (Chorus). Hands up slowly, give in to. Breathe in and take my life in you. No longer myself only you. There?s no escaping me my love. Surrender [4X].

3,evanescence,Sweet Sacrifice,"It's true, we're all a little insane. But its so clear, now that I'm unchained. Fear is only in our minds. Taking over all the time. Fear is only in our minds. But it's taking over all the time. You poor sweet innocent thing. Dry your eyes and testify. You know you live to break me. Don't deny, sweet sacrifice. One day I'm gonna forget your name. And one sweet day,. you're gonna drown in my lost pain. Fear is only in our minds. Taking over all the time. Fear is only in our minds. But it's taking over all the time. You poor sweet innocent thing. Dry your eyes and testify. And oh you love to hate me. Don't you, honey? I'm your sacrifice. [I dream in darkness. I sleep to die. Erase the silence. Erase my life. Our burning ashes. Blacken the day. A world of nothingness. Blow me away]. Do you wonder why you hate?. Are you still too weak. to survive your mistakes?. You poor sweet innocent thing. Dry your eyes and testify. You know you live to break me. Don't deny, sweet sacrifice"
3,evanescence,Swimming Home,"Way down. I've been way down. Underneath this skin. Waiting to hear my name again. I'm sorry, nothing can hold me. I adore you still. But I hear them calling. And nothing can hold me. Way down. All the way down. I will hear your voice. But I'll no longer understand. I'm sorry, nothing can hold me. I adore you still. But I hear them calling.

3,evanescence,Take Cover,"By the way that you talk to me. I can see the lie you're dreaming I'll believe. By the way, don't you forget who you are now. cause that's not your name. You'd better take cover. (Cause I'm on my way now). I'm coming back to take your world down. Move over, if you can. Or you're gonna wish that you did. Slave to your insecurity. That's what drove you down in the first place. but you haven't learned a thing. Caught in your thick web of lies. Gonna be the bitch you make me out to be. Oh you'd better take cover. (Nothing you can say now). You underestimated my wrath. Move over, if you can. I'm gonna give the love back. Take cover. (Cause I'm on my way now). I'm gonna have to take you all down. Move over, if you can. Or you're gonna wish that you did"

I'll give up everything just to find you. I have to be with you to live to breathe. You're taking over me. Have you forgotten all I know. And all we had?. You saw me mourning my love for you. And touched my hand. I knew you loved me then. I believe in you. I'll give up everything just to find you. I have to be with you to live to breathe. you're taking over me. I look in the mirror and see your face. If i look deep enough. So many things inside that are just like you are taking over. believe in you. I'll give up everything just to find you. I have to be with you to live to breathe. You're taking over me
3,evanescence,Taking Over Me (traducción),"tu no me recuerdas pero yo si te recuerdo. estoy acostada despierta y tratando de no pensar en ti. ¿pero quien puede decidir que soñar?. y yo sueño.... yo creo en ti. renunciare solo para encontrarte. tengo que estar contigo para vivir, para respirar. tu tienes el poder sobre mi. ¿has olvidado todolo que se. y todo lo que teniamos?. me viste llorar por la muerte de mi amor por ti. y tocaste mi mano. supe que me amabas en ese entonces. yo creo en ti.... miro el espejo y veo tu cara. si miro con suficinte profundidad. tienas el poder. sobre tantas cosas en mi interior"
3,evanescence,The Change,"Thought that I was strong. I know the words I need to say. Frozen in my place. I let the moment slip away. I've been screaming. On the inside. And I know you feel the pain. Can you hear me?. Can you hear me?. Say it's over. Yes, it's over. But I need you anyway. Say you love me, but it's not enough. Never meant to lie. But I'm not the girl you think you know. The more that I am with you. The more that I am all alone. I've been screaming. On the inside. And I know you feel the pain. Can you hear me?. Can you hear me?. Say it's over. Yes, it's over. But I need you anyway. Say you love me, but it's not enough. Not that I'm so different. Not that I don't see. The dying light of what we used to be. How can I forgive you?. You changed!. And I'm a liar by your side. I'm about to lose my mind. 'Cause I've been screaming. On the inside. And I know you feel the pain. Can you hear me?. Can you hear me?. You've been dreaming. If you're thinking. That I still belong to you. And I've been dying. 'Cause I'm lying to myself!. Say it's over. Yes, it's over. But I need you anyway. Say you love me, but it's not enough"

3,evanescence,The End Of The Dream,"I found a grave. Brushed off the face. Felt your light. And I remember why I know this place. I found a bird. Closing her eyes one last time. And I wonder if she dreamed like me. As much as it hurts, ain't it wonderful to feel?. So go on and break your wings. Follow your heart till it bleeds. As we run towards the end of the dream. I'm not afraid. I push through the pain. And I'm on fire. I remember how to breathe again. As much as it hurts, ain't it wonderful to feel?. So go on and break your wings. Follow your heart till it bleeds. As we run towards the end of the dream. Why must we fall apart. To understand how to fly. I will find a way. Even without wings. Follow your heart till it bleeds. As we run towards the end of the dream. Follow your heart till it bleeds. And we've gone to the end of the dream"
3,evanescence,The Last Song I'm Wasting On You,"Sparkling Gray,. They're my own veins. Any more than a whisper. Any sudden movement of my heart. And I know, I know I'll have to watch them pass away. Just get through this day. Give up your way, you could be anything,. Give up my way, and lose myself, not today. That's too much guilt to pay. Sickened in the sun. You dare tell me you love me. But you held me down and screamed you wanted me to die. Honey you know, you know I'd never hurt you that way.. You're just so pretty in your pain.. Give up my way, and I could be anything. I'll make my own way. Without your senseless hate.... So run, run, run. And hate me, if it feels good. I can't hear your screams anymore. You lied to me. But I'm older now. And I'm not buying baby. Demanding my response. Don't bother breaking the door down. I found my way out. And you'll never hurt me again."
3,evanescence,The Only One,"You know you're not the only one. When they all come crashing down (midflight). You know you're not the only one. When they're so alone they find. A back door out of life. You know you're not the only one. We're all grieving. Lost and bleeding. All our lives. We've been waiting. For someone to call our leader. All your lies. I'm not believing. Heaven shine a light down on me. So afraid to open your eyes (hypnotized). You know you're not the only one. Never understood this life. And you're right I don't deserve. But you know I'm not the only one. We're all grieving. Lost and bleeding. All our lives. We've been waiting. For someone to call our leader. All your lies. I'm not believing. Heaven shine a light down on me. Don't look down. Don't look into the eyes of the world beneath you. Don't look down. You'll fall down. You'll become their sacrifice. Right or wrong. Can't hold on to the fear. That I'm lost without you. If I can't feel, I'm not mine,. I'm not real. All our lives. We've been waiting. For someone to call our leader. All your lies. I'm not believing. Heaven shine a light down on me"
3,evanescence,The Other Side,Make me whole again. Open your eyes. Taunted by the shadows of your light. Cold and far away. Like you're not even mine. Undo everything and take me. Higher. Never believing what they say cause I'm.... Counting the days to meet you on the other side. I will always be waiting. Until the day that I see you on the other side. Come and take me home. I'm not giving you. I want you back. Holding together by the shards of our past. Stole my heart away. I can't let you go. Break these chains and let me fly to you. High above the world below. Over and over in my mind. Counting the days to meet you on the other side. I will always be waiting. Until the day that I see you on the other side. Come and take me.... Home. I am so lost without my place inside your heart. I won't survive I need to know you hear me. Awake and release my love. Counting the days to meet you on the other side. I will always be waiting. Until the day that I see you on the other side. Come and take me. Counting the days to meet you on the other side. I will always be waiting. Until the day that I see you on the other side. Come and take me home

3,evanescence,Together Again,Never tought that I'd be leaving you today. So alone and wondering why I feel this way. So wide the world. Can love remember how to get me home to you someday?. We'll be together again. All just a dream in the end. We'll be together again. So many fears were swimming around and around in my mind. Who would have dreamed the secrets we would find?. I've found a world where love and dreams and darkness all colide. Maybe this time we can leave our broken world behind. We'll be together again. All just I dream in the end
3,evanescence,Tourniquet,I tried to kill the pain. But only brought more (so much more). I lay dying. And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal. I'm dying praying bleeding and screaming. Am I too lost to be saved?. Am I too lost?. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. Do you remember me. Lost for so long. Will you be on the other side. Or will you forget me. I'm dying praying bleeding and screaming. Am I too lost to be saved. Am I too lost?. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. I want to die. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. My wounds cry for the grave. My soul cries for deliverance. Will I be denied christ. Tourniquet. My suicide

(Though they're screaming your name). Don't close your eyes. (God knows what lies behind them). Don't turn out the light. (Never sleep, never die). Fallen angels at my feet. Whispered voices at my ear. Death before my eyes. Lying next to me, I fear. She beckons me, shall I give in?. Upon my end, shall I begin?. Forsaking all I've fallen. For I rise to meet the end. . Don't turn away. (Don't give in to the pain). Don't try to hide. (Though they're screaming your name). Don't close your eyes. (God knows what lies behind them). Don't turn out the light.

3,evanescence,You,"The words have been drained from this pencil. Sweet words that I want to give you. And I can't sleep, I need to tell you... goodnight. When we're together I feel perfect. When I'm pulled away from you I fall apart. All that you say is sacred to me. Your eyes are so blue, I can't look away as we lay in the stillness. You whisper to me:. -Amy, marry me, promise you'll stay with me. Oh you don't have to ask me, you know you're all that I live for. You know I'd die just to hold you, stay with you. Somehow I'll show you that you are my night sky. I've always been right behind you. Now I'll always be right beside you. So many nights I've cried myself to sleep. Now that you love me I love myself. I never thought I would say that. I never thought there'd be you"

Todo lo que tú dices es sagrado para mí. tus ojos son tan azules, no puedo mirar lejos como nos ponemos en calma. tú me susurras, dama, cásate conmigo, promete que te quedarás conmigo. oh tú no tienes que preguntarme, tú sabes que eres todo para lo que vivo. tú sabes que yo moriría solamente para sostenerte, quedarme contigo. De algún modo te mostraré que tú eres mi cielo de la noche. yo siempre tenía la razón detrás de tí. Ahora siempre tendré la razón al lado tuyo. Tantas noches me he gritado para dormir. Nunca pensé que diría esto. Nunca pensé que ahí estarías tú."

3,evanescence,Zero,"My reflection, dirty mirror. There's no connection to myself. I'm your lover, I'm your zero. I'm the face in your dreams of glass. So save your prayers. For when you're really gonna need 'em. Throw out your cares and fly. Wanna go for a ride?. She's the one for me. She's all I really need. 'Cause she's the one for me. Emptiness is loneliness and loneliness is cleanliness. And cleanliness is godliness, and God is empty just like me. Intoxicated with the madness. I'm in love with my sadness. Bullshit fakers, enchanted kingdoms. The fashion victims chew their charcoal teeth. I never let on that I was on a sinking ship. I never let on that I was down. You blame yourself, for what you can't ignore. You blame yourself for wanting more. She's the one for me. She's all I really need. She's the one for me. She's my one and only"

Like the way you slip. There ain't nothing like a two's up. That's the way it is, two's up. It's what I want to hear. Give me head, give me tails. Give me doubled up and coming over on the rails. Two's up, it's locomotion. Two's up, you're drivin' me wild. Give me high, give me low. Give me twice the satisfaction. Twice the pot of gold (?). And it's a two's up. It's gonna be two's up. We're gonna have a two's up, two's up, two's up, two's up. There ain't nothin' like a two's up. [Marcos A. Tancon]"

I'm telling you. You come along when I needed you. Now I'm up. I'm up to my neck in you. And I be up yo my neck in pleasure. Up to my neck in pain. I've been up to my neck on the railroad track. Waiting for the train, to cruise on trought. Well baby I'm tired with you. It was way overdue. You come along and you pull me trough. Now I'm up! Oh!. Up to my nneck in you. Well I've been up to my neck in whisky. I've been up to my neck in wine. I've been up to my neck in whishin'. That this neck wasn't mine. I was a loser. (You are lost!). Baby you are to good! To good to be true!. What you've done no one else could do. Now I'm up, I'm up to my neck in you. (Other few could...). Yeah, you come along when I needed you, ooow. I'm up to my neck in you"
4,ac-dc,Walk All Over You,"Outta my way, I'm runnin' high,. Take a chance with me n' I'll give it a try. Ain't no woman in the world I know,. 'Cause I ain't lookin' for an overflow. Oh baby, I ain't got much,. Resistance to your touch. Take off the high heels, let down your hair,. Ooh, paradise ain't far from there. I wanna walk all over you (Walk all over you!). I wanna walk all over you (Walk all over you!). Do anything you want me to, baby (Walk all over you!). I wanna walk all over you... ow!. Reflection's on the bedroom wall,. And there you thought you'd see it all. We're risin', fallin' like the sea,. You're lookin' so good under me. I'm gonna walk all over you (Walk all over you!). I'm gonna walk all over you (Walk all over you!). Do anything you want me to, to you (Walk all over you!). I'm gonna walk all over... you! Oh walk!. Whoa! Moanin', groanin' stereo,.

Gimme that thing and feed your war.... War Machine. Make a stand, show your hand. Call in the high command. Don't think, just obey. I'm like a bird of prey. So better get your name, come on in. Gimme that thing and feed your war.... War Machine. Better watch your back. N` cover your tracks. Kick your foot. through the door. Hit the deck, know the score. They take you by surprise. And here's mud in your eye. This will be the day. they shouldn't forget. Call of the wild,. hungry for more. And feed your.... War Machine. Let's go. I've seen your war .... War Machine"
4,ac-dc,What do You do For Money Honey,"You're workin in bars, ridin in cars. Never gonna give it for free. Your apartment with a view. On the finest avenue. Lookin at your beat on the street. You're always pushin, shovin. Satisfied with nothing. You bitch you must be gettin old. So stop your love on the road. All your diggin for gold. You make me wonder. Yes I wonder. I wonder. Honey, what do you do for money. Honey, what do you do for money. How do ya get your kicks?. You're ridin on the take and you're always on the make. Squeezin all the blood out of men. They're standin in a queue just to spend the night with you. It's business as usual again. You're always grabbin, stabbin. Tryin to get it back but girl you must be gettin slow. So stop your love on the road. All your diggin for gold. You make me wonder. Yes I wonder. Yes I wonder. Honey, what do you do for money. Honey, what do you do for money. What do you do for money honey?. How do you get your kicks?. What do you do for money honey?. How do you get your licks?. What you gonna do?. Aw what you gonna do?"
4,ac-dc,What's Next To The Moon,"Well I tied my baby to the railroad track. Cannonball down the line. Giving that woman just a one more chance. To give it to me one more time. Engineer wishing he was home in bed. Dreaming about Casey Jones. Wide-eyed woman heading a mile ahead. Thinking about broken bones. (CHORUS:). It's her love that I want. It's her love that I need. It's her love got to have. It's her love. Heavenly body flying across the sky. Superman was out of town. Come on honey, gotta change your tune. Cause it's a long way down. Clark Kent looking for a free ride. Thinking about Louise Lane. It's a bird, it's a plane, it's - a suicide. And that'd be a shame. (CHORUS:). It's her love that I want. It's her love that I need. It's her love got to have. It's her love. But what's next to the moon?. Long Arm looking for a fingerprint. Trying to find the mystery clue. Hitting me with the third degree. Working on a thumb screw. Alright, officer, I confess. Everything's coming back. I didn't mean to hurt that woman of mine. It was a heart attack. (CHORUS:). It's her love that I want. It's her love that I need. It's her love got to have. It's her love. What's next to the moon. If not the sky, oh baby, say bye-bye."

The earth was quakin. My mind was achin. And we were making it you. (chorus). Shook me all night long. Yeah you. Shook me all night long. An knocked me out and then you. Shook me all night long. Had me shakin and then you. Shook me all night loong. Well you took me. Well you took me. . Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. . Heres the spiecial news bullitan. Stand by. Heres the apiecial news bullitan. Stand by for action. Shot to the heart and your to blame. Shot to the heart. Shot to the heart. Shot to the heart and your to blame. Darlin you give love a bad name. . When your high you never ever want to get down. So down. So down. So down huh!"
