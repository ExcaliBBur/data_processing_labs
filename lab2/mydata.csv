Pop," Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by I say to myself, ""Youre such a lucky guy"" To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true Out of all the fellas in the world she belongs to me  But it was just my imagination Runnin away with me It was just my imagination Runnin away with me  Soon, soon well be married and raise a family A cozy, little home out in the country With two children, maybe three I tell you, I can visualize it all This couldnt be a dream for too real it all seems  But it was just my imagination, once again Runnin away with me I tell you it was just my imagination Runnin away with me  Every night, on my knees I pray ""Dear Lord, hear my plea Dont ever let another take her love from me Or I will surely die""  Her love is Heavenly When her arms enfold me I hear a tender rhapsody But in reality, she doesnt even know me  Just my imagination, once again Runnin away with me I tell you it was just my imagination Runnin away with me  I never met her, but I cant forget her Just my imagination Runnin away with me Just my imagination Runnin away with me ",THE TEMPTATIONS - JUST MY IMAGINATION (RUNNING AWAY WITH ME) LYRICS
Christian," This might hurt, its not safe But I know that Ive gotta make a change I dont care if I break At least Ill be feeling something  Cause just okay is not enough Help me fight through the nothingness of life  I dont wanna go through the motions I dont wanna go one more day Without Your all consuming passion inside of me  I dont wanna spend my whole life asking What if I had given everything Instead of going through the motions?  No regrets, not this time Im gonna let my heart defeat my mind Let Your love make me whole I think Im finally feeling something  Cause just okay is not enough Help me fight through the nothingness of this life  Cause I dont wanna go through the motions I dont wanna go one more day Without Your all consuming passion inside of me  I dont wanna spend my whole life asking What if I had given everything Instead of going through the motions?  Take me all the way (Take me all the way) Take me all the way (Cause I dont wanna go through the motions)  Take me all the way (Lord, Im finally feeling something real) Take me all the way  I dont wanna go through the motions I dont wanna go one more day Without Your all consuming passion inside of me  I dont wanna spend my whole life asking What if I had given everything Instead of going through the motions?  I dont wanna go through the motions I dont wanna go one more day Without Your all consuming passion inside of me  I dont wanna spend my whole life asking What if I had given everything Instead of going through the motions?  Take me all the way (Take me all the way) Take me all the way (I dont wanna go, I dont wanna go)  Take me all the way   (Through the motions) Take me all the way  I dont wanna go through the motions ",MATTHEW WEST - THE MOTIONS LYRICS
